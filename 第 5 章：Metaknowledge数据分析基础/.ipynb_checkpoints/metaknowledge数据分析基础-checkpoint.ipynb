      "AB We develop a model of scientific creativity and test it in the field of rare diseases. Our model is based on the results of an in-depth case study of the Rett Syndrome. Archival analysis, bibliometric techniques and expert surveys are combined with network analysis to identify the most creative scientists. First, we compare alternative measures of generative and combinatorial creativity. Then, we generalize our results in a stochastic model of socio-semantic network evolution. The model predictions are tested with an extended set of rare diseases. We find that new scientific collaborations among experts in a field enhance combinatorial creativity. Instead, high entry rates of novices are negatively related to generative creativity. By expanding the set of useful concepts, creative scientists gain in centrality. At the same time, by increasing their centrality in the scientific community, scientists can replicate and generalize their results, thus contributing to a scientific paradigm.\n",

Our model is based on the results of an in-depth case study of the Rett Syndrome. Archival analysis, bibliometric techniques and expert surveys are combined with network analysis to identify the most creative scientists. First, we compare alternative measures of generative and combinatorial creativity. Then, we generalize our results in a stochastic model of socio-semantic network evolution. The model predictions are tested with an extended set of rare diseases. We find that new scientific collaborations among experts in a field enhance combinatorial creativity. Instead, high entry rates of novices are negatively related to generative creativity. By expanding the set of useful concepts, creative scientists gain in centrality. At the same time, by increasing their centrality in the scientific community, scientists can replicate and generalize their results, thus contributing to a scientific paradigm.\",\\n    C1 = \"Univ Trento, Dept Management & Comp Sci, I-38100 Trento, Italy.\",\\n    RP = \"Frigotto, ML (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Dept Management & Comp Sci, Via Inama 5, I-38100 Trento, Italy.\",\\n    EM = \"marialaura.frigotto@unitn.it\",\\n    RI = \"White, Howard D/A-7034-2009\",\\n    OI = \"RICCABONI, Massimo/0000-0003-4979-8933 and Frigotto, Maria Laura/0000-0001-9766-5591\",\\n    CR = \"Amabile T.
