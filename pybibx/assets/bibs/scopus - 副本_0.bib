 abstract = {The usefulness and relevance of association rules extracted by the generation algorithms are a critical problem. In fact, in most cases, the real datasets lead to a very large number of association rules, which does not allow users to make their own selection of the most relevant. The searching of the best from the vast array of extracted rules require the identification and use of good measures or techniques of choice. Partial panoramas of these are presented in numerous publications. In this context, we propose a new approach to selecting relevant categories of association rules based on multi criteria analysis using association rules as actions and measures as criteria. © 2015 IEEE.},

 abstract = {This works aims at defining a multi criteria decision making method for the evaluation of sustainable urban projects. This integrated approach starts by investigating and describing the system of sustainable oriented goals of each decision makers working on an urban project. By modeling the final objectives in the form of tree structure, one obtains the reference frame which will make it possible to evaluate a sustainable performance for each decision maker. Then we will use a specific algebra to merge the tree structure of each actor of the decision process into a generic tree structure. Next we build criteria (indicators of sustainability) to represent each objective. Each criterion is provided with standard values to define various distances to the objective. Lastly, by incorporating the criteria on any level of the tree structure, and by using the Electre-Tri aggregation method, it is proposed an evaluation of each objective. A computer tool baptized Impact is embedding these various techniques. © 2007 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {With the increase in the number of smartphones, the use of mobile applications is growing dramatically in today's high-tech environment. With this high user demand, the quality of mobile applications is becoming a serious issue. With the perspective of quality enhancement, these applications must be smart enough so that they can handle any kind of issue automatically. Also, with the increasing complexity of these applications, they need to be more self-managed for better operability and interoperability. The self-management features allow handling issues such as error handling, optimization, resource utilization, configuration management etc. by its own. This will lead to the better functionality of mobile applications. The present research work proposes to incorporate autonomic capability as an attribute for assessing mobile applications. A multi-criteria decision-making approach named ELECTRE-TRI outranking method is used to evaluate the self-management aspect i.e. the autonomic capability of mobile applications to provide the quality estimation of mobile applications a better way. © 2019, IGI Global.},

 abstract = {With the expansion in the quantity of cell phone utilization, mobile applications are developing significantly in today’s high-tech environment. With this high demand, the quality of mobile applications is turning into a major issue. The organizations are still finding a way to develop quality applications. The number of quality models has already been proposed for assessing the quality of a mobile application but none of them provide a holistic view towards quality assurance. The present research work proposes an empirical evaluation of the SQM-MApp quality model using a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making approach named ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELimination and Choice Expressing REality) (ELECTRE-TRI) method and step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method for ranking and determining weights of chosen quality factors respectively. The proposed approach specifically is for the mobile applications that are from the gaming domain. Also, validation of the proposed approach is performed by assessing the quality of gaming applications. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.},

 abstract = {The present paper addresses the relevant topic of maintenance management, widely recognised as a fundamental issue involving complex engineering systems and leading companies towards the optimisation of their assets while pursuing cost efficiency. With this regard, our research aims to provide companies with a hybrid methodological approach based on Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) capable to deal with the main failures potentially involving complex systems subjected to predictive maintenance. Such an approach is going to be integrated within the framework of traditional Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), whose strengths and weaknesses are considered. In particular, the ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE) TRI is suggested to sort failure modes into risk priority classes while the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) is proposed to highlight the most influencing failures within each risk class. The approach is applied to a real service system, whose critical components are monitored by sensors and subjected to predictive maintenance. Final results clearly demonstrate as highlighting the elements impacting the occurrence of other failures within specific risk classes is a significant driver towards the implementation of effective maintenance, maximising the whole level of performance of the analysed system over its lifecycle. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Association rule mining plays a vital role in knowledge discovery in databases. The difficult task is mining useful and non-redundant rules, in fact in most cases, the real datasets lead to a huge number of rules, which does not allow users to make their own selection of the most relevant. Several techniques are proposed such as rule clustering, informative cover method, quality measurements, etc. Another way to selecting relevant association rules, we believe it is necessary to integrate a decisional approach within the knowledge discovery process; to solve the problem, we propose an approach to discover a category of relevant association rules based on multi-criteria analysis (MCA) by using association rules as actions and quality measurements as criteria. Finally, we conclude our work by an empirical study to illustrate the performance of our proposed approach. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

 abstract = {The Case-Based Reasoning methodology is used to develop Knowledge Management Systems (KMS). First, this paper introduces various case-based reasoning cycles. Next, the focus is on defining procedures for case indexing. The procedures are based on multiple-criteria methods supporting a decision-making process, such as EUCLID and ELECTRE TRI. The indexing procedures form also a knowledge transformation cycle (from implicit to explicit knowledge) known as externalization. The author developed a subsystem, which supports the implementation of this cycle. The UML diagrams show the structure of the SOK-P1 subsystem. The author developed an ontology of enterprise assessment. The subsystem presented uses the taxonomies of the enterprise potential and business risks, as well as thesauruses, which are a set of suggestions for assessors. © 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

 abstract = {The paper includes description of the main elements of a decision support system (DSS) for positioning enterprises according to assessment of their competences. An enterprise model created according to original conception of defining features is presented. In the author’s conception, it is assumed that the enterprise competence system is the object which is assessed. The system is assessed from two points of view: assessment of competence potential and assessment of competence gap. A procedure of making assessment in the ranges determined by the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) method is depicted. A procedure of explanation of the enterprise position based on an adaptation of the EUCLID and ELECTRE TRI methods is given. Results of research on the SME sector in south-east Poland are presented. These results lead to distinguishing four classes of assessment of enterprise positions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.},

 abstract = {This study presents the first attempt to develop classification models for the prediction of share repurchase announcements using multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) techniques. We use three samples consisting of 434 UK firms, 330 French firms, and 296 German firms, to develop country-specific models. The MCDA techniques that are applied for the development of the models are the UTilités Additives DIScriminantes (UTADIS) and the ELimination and Choice Expressing REality (ELECTRE) TRI. We adopt a 10-fold cross validation approach, a re-sampling technique that allows us to split the datasets in training and validation sub-samples. Thus, at the first stage of the analysis the aim is the development of a model capable of reproducing the classification of the firms considered in the training samples. Once this stage is completed, the model can be used for the classification of new firms not included in the training samples (i.e. validation stage). The results show that both MCDA models achieve quite satisfactory classification accuracies in the validation sample and they outperform both logistic regression and chance predictions. The developed models could provide the basis for a decision tool for various stakeholders such as managers, shareholders, and investment analysts. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {With the strengthening of corporate social responsibility, the need for an evaluation of the environmental performance exists and appears more and more meaningful for the companies. This research paper presents an experiment implemented within the Total Company about impact on water of the refineries. We first describe the context in which we built an evaluation tool which delivers a synthesis indicator. Then, we explain how this tool, based on Electre Tri, works. Afterwards, we present a “formalized” dialog process which allowed us to implement this tool. As a conclusion, this research paper aims to highlight what it could be considered as an added value of this evaluation tool. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

 abstract = {Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) face many obstacles when they try to access the credit market. These obstacles increase if the SMEs are innovative. In this case, financial data are insufficient or even unreliable. Thus, building a judgmental rating model, mainly based on qualitative criteria (soft information), is very important to finance SMEs' activities. Till now, there has not been a multicriteria credit risk model based on soft information for innovative SMEs. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by presenting a multicriteria credit risk model named ELECTRE-TRI. A SMAA-TRI analysis is also implemented to obtain robust SMEs' assignments to the risk classes. SMAA-TRI incorporates ELECTRE-TRI by considering different sets of preference parameters and uncertainty in the data via Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we carry out a real case study with the aim of illustrating the multicriteria credit risk model. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {The major challenge for agriculture today is to reduce the pesticide use while maintaining a satisfactory level of yield, quality and profitability. As part of a research project, we studied the use of pesticides in the wine region of Bordeaux. We evaluated the performance of existing viticultural systems and proposed scenarios for changing practices to reduce the reliance on pesticides. We surveyed 39 winegrowers adopting different crop practices. We evaluated the systems using multi-criteria decision aid methods: ELECTRE Tri-C and ELECTRE III. We selected seven criteria of evaluation for socioeconomic performance (economic profitability, workload, and complexity of the system) and environmental performance (pesticide pressure, ecotoxicity of pesticides, agro-ecological practices, pesticide drift). We built three scenarios for changing practices including the best practices identified in the field: the first one optimizes conventional practices (Maximized-conventional system); the two others adopt an agroecological approach: Agroecological system (with optimized use of synthetic chemicals) and Agroecology-organic system (without synthetic chemicals). ELECTRE Tri-C sorted the existing systems and the three scenarios into one of the four pre-defined categories of performance. Then ELECTRE III classified them in each category. Organic systems as well as agroecological scenarios were assigned into high-level performances. This result can be explained by the high level of profitability and the low level of pesticide pressure in these systems associated to practices that enhance biodiversity in the vineyard. These results, based on realistic approaches, are adaptable models for conventional agriculture. © N. Aouadi et al., Hosted by EDP Sciences 2020.},

 abstract = {In this paper is described the implementation of a multi-criteria analysis in order to answer a question of researchers of the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) who assess the impact of agricultural practices on the environmental components. They were particularly interested in differentiating cropping systems (CSs) as a function of their impact on groundwater quality. In order to give effect to this differentiation, members of the Laboratoire d'Analyse et de Modelisation de Systemes pour l'Aide a la Decision (LAMSADE) proposed a way of sorting CSs using the ELECTRE TRI method. Four categories of impact were defined and three families of criteria were built up. The main debate was about the nature of criteria: if basic data are used, the number of the criteria is high; if aggregated data are used, exchanges of information are tedious. In spite of difficulties, the study has been of important value for the agronomic researchers. Firstly, it helps them to work with decision-makers, such as the Water Agency: it allows farmers to be given concrete examples of CSs which preserve groundwater quality. Secondly, the multi-criteria methodology used seems to fit their researches: they are indeed now using the same approach to differentiate CSs on the basis of their impact on wild fauna or landscape quality.},

 abstract = {Saving energy in MANET represents a critical issue due to its material architecture. This paper aims to improve ad-hoc on-demand multipath distance vector routing (AOMDV) using multicriteria analysis method. In order to construct effective disjoints paths, our approach focuses on sorting the different available paths considering several important criteria. Our objective is improving the network performances and routing stability using an efficient multicriteria method called Electre Tri. The use of this technique enhances data reach ability and minimises the required delay during packets forwarding. The proposed approach is evaluated comparatively to well known routing protocols considering various metrics. Simulation results prove that our approach improves significantly the network lifetime and the transmission delay. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

 abstract = {Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) has found many applications in both technical and research sectors. MCA is a way to break the problem into more practicable elements, to permit data and decisions to be judgements to support the elements, and make the right decision. The aim of this paper is to analyze, compare, and make decisions of various current, and future scenarios of different quantifiable indicators for different considerations and various socio-economic aspects. Furthermore, this analysis is used to improve or at least to preserve the environment and natural resources in the basin. In this study an application by a real data set is made, these data are evaluated and extracted from classified satellite images of Loukkos basin, the classification of this satellite images regroups several classes of the data set such as agglomeration, dams, watercourses, croplands, bare soils and forests ... etc. In reality, these data come from different sources like watershed information system (drinking water supply, irrigation system), transportation infrastructures (roads, dams), natural resources (Water, soils, and vegetation), human activities (agriculture, urbanization, and industry) and different socio-economic factors (demography). The main objective of this work is sorting the environmental indicators using the ELECTRE TRI tool, where ten alternatives are considered. We focus the classification of the real data set into the altitude, and the combined surface area factors. The obtained results prove that the classification is stable and the multi-criteria approach ELECTRE-TRI is suitable to a better sorting of the environmental indicators for the Loukkos Basin located in Morocco. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The system supports the multi-faceted (multi-methodical) and multi-criteria decision analysis, which includes: the selection (MLP optimization), ranking (AHP) and grouping (Electre Tri) of decision variants (called the objects of analysis). The first part of the study focused on the transformation of the information structure of partial mathematical models, reflecting the objects of analysis, to the form of records of the database and on their connection into a more complex structure, so-called multi-model, in order to subject the method of multi-criteria optimization to calculations. There was also mentioned the possibility of transformation of these complex structures from data records to a simple, tabular form transferred on the inputs of method. In the second part discussed the issue of the bi-directional data transformation (from the linguistic form into numerical, and vice versa). Data transformations are based on the use of fuzzy set logic and specially developed for thus purpose scoring and linguistic scales of the ordinal nature. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

 abstract = {The aim of the article was to present the model of integration and cooperation (hybridization) of selected methods of decision support as a specific research procedure. The model is the basis for the construction of the so-called decision-making dashboard, which is the main module of the academic, prototype version of the multi-criteria decision support system - DSS 3.0 [1], [2]. Three methods were hybridized: AHP/ANP and ELECTRE TRI included in the area of multi-criteria decision analysis and the method of identification and econometric evaluation based on multiple regression analysis. Due to the limited volume of the study, the description of the algorithms of these methods was abandoned. The focus was on defining the set of input data common to the above-mentioned methods and on the description of the integration process of the results of the decision analysis obtained with their use, indicating the effects of their synergy. The properties of the model are illustrated on a practical example of employee team assessment (case study). The decision making dashboard provided answers to some interesting questions. How is the ranking of employees shaped? What is the overall assessment of a given employee (or candidate for a position) compared to the results of the entire staff? What is the distribution of the number of assignments of the ranked employees to the established classes (profiles) of multi-criteria assessment? Are the ranking favourites in the group of the highest, average or poorly rated employees? What is the ratio of the level of employees' remuneration to the ratings obtained in the ranking? © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {We introduce a novel anomaly intrusion detection method based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). This approach searches for those vectors in the underlying space that best discriminate among users' profile classes. The discrimination rules are based on linear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply LDA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes. Thus one can easily determine if a new student is legitimate or not by projecting its profile onto the profile subspace. Simulations show that our approach outperforms both Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Electre Tri methods. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

 abstract = {Regulation of pesticides in agricultural sector is becoming increasingly oriented to the use of best management practices in order to counter the effect of agricultural practices on health and groundwater. Several distinct criteria (economic, technical, environmental, social and informational criteria) need to be considered in the decision-making process. Moreover, the preferences of actors can vary according to the different management strategies and vested interests. In considering this context, a regional survey has been conducted in order to collect information on IPM opportunity. IPM is a pesticides management system which helps to solve pest problems while reducing environmental damage and increasing productivity. In conjunction with this regional survey, a multicriteria approach has been applied in order to help the decision-making process. ELECTRE-tri has been used and IPM opportunity evaluated from the results of the national survey and a critical review. Above all, key factors and impediments concerning the implementation of IPM have been identified. copyright © 2009 inderscience enterprises ltd.},

 abstract = {We propose a decision-aiding evaluation procedure (i) for classifying road crossings based on their impact on walkability and, subsequently, (ii) for prioritising street improvements, in urban-rural fringe areas. In the peripheral urban-rural fringes, pedestrian mobility is usually less developed and people generally depend more on cars for their everyday chores. Partly this is inevitable given the structural features and supply of services and activities in such areas, but part is due to a frequent neglect of pedestrian mobility in planning and urban design. Measures to improve this state of affairs can include the design of more pedestrian-friendly environments offering to potential users a greater level of security, comfort and convenience when walking to their designated destinations. Our evaluation procedure combines a walkability assessment methodology with the ELECTRE TRI rating procedure, in order to assist planners and decision makers in designing physical streets to enhance the continuity, safety and quality of pedestrian paths. Improving the walking accessibility in the fringe areas of towns is a way to reduce the physical and perceptual distance which separates these contexts from the rest of the city, thus leading to a progressive integration of urban functions. © 2017 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Walkability Explorer is a software tool for the evaluation of urban walkability which, we argue, is an important aspect of the quality of life in cities. Many conventional approaches to the assessment of quality of life measure the distribution, density and distances of different opportunities in space. But distance is not all there is. To reason in terms of urban capabilities of people we should also take into account the quality of pedestrian accessibility and of urban opportunities offered by the city. The software tool we present in this paper is an user-friendly implementation of such an evaluation approach to walkability. It includes several GIS and analysis features, and is interoperable with other standard GIS and data-analysis tools. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

 abstract = {In the literature on MCDM, many methods have been proposed in order to sort alternatives evaluated on several attributes into ordered categories. Most of them were proposed on an ad hoc basis. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a recent trend of research aiming at giving these methods sound theoretical foundations. Using tools from conjoint measurement, we provide an axiomatic analysis of the partitions of alternatives into two categories that can be obtained using what we call "noncompensatory sorting models". These models have strong links with the pessimistic version of ELECTRE TRI. Our analysis allows to pinpoint what appears to be the main distinctive features of ELECTRE TRI when compared to other sorting methods. It also gives hints on the various methods that have been proposed to assess the parameters of ELECTRE TRI on the basis of assignment examples. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {A number of recent papers have investigated the foundations of methods allowing to sort multi-attributed alternatives between several ordered categories. This paper has a similar objective. Our analysis uses a general conjoint measurement framework, encompassing most sorting models used in MDCM, that was proposed in the literature. Within this framework, we provide an axiomatic analysis of what we call noncompensatory sorting models, with or without veto effects. These noncompensatory sorting models contain the pessimistic version of ELECTRE TRI as a particular case.

 abstract = {ELECTRE TRI is a set of methods designed to sort alternatives evaluated on several criteria into ordered categories. The original method uses limiting profiles. A recently introduced method uses central profiles. We study the relations between these two methods. We do so by investigating if an ordered partition obtained with one method can also be obtained with the other method, after a suitable redefinition of the profiles. We also investigate a number of situations in which the original method using limiting profiles gives results that do not fit well our intuition. This leads us to propose a variant of ELECTRE TRI that uses limiting profiles. We show that this variant may have some advantages over the original method. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {This paper discusses the properties of the asymmetric part of an outranking relation built as in ELECTRE. Such relations have been used in the pseudodisjunctive version of ELECTRE TRI-B. We show that they have properties that are somewhat different from that of outranking relations. Indeed, contrary to outranking relations, they allow to have at the same time veto and bonus effects. We suggest that this explains the difficulty in analyzing the properties of the pseudodisjunctive version of ELECTRE TRI-B and the complexity of the elicitation methods of its parameters. We present conditions that characterize such relations. © 2014 The Authors. International Transactions in Operational Research © 2014 International Federation of Operational Research Societies.},

 abstract = {ELECTRE TRI-nB is a method designed to sort alternatives evaluated on several attributes into ordered categories. It is an extension of ELECTRE TRI-B that uses several limiting profiles, instead of one, to delimit each category. In a previous paper we have characterized the ordered partitions that can be obtained with ELECTRE TRI-nB, using a simple axiom called linearity. The simplicity of this characterization crucially rests on the possibility to use as many limiting profiles as we like to delimit a category. This is not completely realistic and there is a need to study models in which the number of limiting profiles delimiting each category is restricted. This note starts the investigation of such models. We specifically study the case of models using one or two profiles together with an outranking relation based on unanimity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

 abstract = {Robustness analysis and visualization are two of key concepts of multi-criteria decision support. They enable the decision-maker to improve his understanding of both the model and the problem domain. A class of original mathematical optimization based robustness metrics is hence defined in this paper. In addition, several efficient existing techniques that have been successfully used in various ICT projects are presented. They include the stability intervals/regions and the principal components analysis. All approaches are applied to the multi-attribute utility function, and to the PROMETHEE II and ELECTRE TRI methods. Their benefits are discussed and demonstrated on real life cases.},

 abstract = {To satisfy their main goal, namely providing quality water to consumers, water distribution networks (WDNs) need to be suitably monitored. Only well designed and reliable monitoring data enables WDN managers to make sound decisions on their systems. In this belief, water utilities worldwide have invested in monitoring and data acquisition systems. However, good monitoring needs optimal sensor placement and presents a multi-objective problem where cost and quality are conflicting objectives (among others). In this paper, we address the solution to this multi-objective problem by integrating quality simulations using EPANET-MSX, with two optimization techniques. First, multi-objective optimization is used to build a Pareto front of non-dominated solutions relating contamination detection time and detection probability with cost. To assist decision makers with the selection of an optimal solution that provides the best trade-off for their utility, a multi-criteria decision-making technique is then used with a twofold objective: 1) to cluster Pareto solutions according to network sensitivity and entropy as evaluation parameters; and 2) to rank the solutions within each cluster to provide deeper insight into the problem when considering the utility perspectives.The clustering process, which considers features related to water utility needs and available information, helps decision makers select reliable and useful solutions from the Pareto front. Thus, while several works on sensor placement stop at multi-objective optimization, this work goes a step further and provides a reduced and simplified Pareto front where optimal solutions are highlighted. The proposed methodology uses the NSGA-II algorithm to solve the optimization problem, and clustering is performed through ELECTRE TRI. The developed methodology is applied to a very well-known benchmarking WDN, for which the usefulness of the approach is shown. The final results, which correspond to four optimal solution clusters, are useful for decision makers during the planning and development of projects on networks of quality sensors. The obtained clusters exhibit distinctive features, opening ways for a final project to prioritize the most convenient solution, with the assurance of implementing a Pareto-optimal solution. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.},

The focus is on the discussion of the transformation of the information structure of partial mathematical models, reflecting the objects of analysis, to the form of records of the database and on their connection into a more complex structure, so-called multi-model, in order to subject the method of multi-criteria optimization to calculations. There was also mentioned the possibility of transformation of these complex structures from data records to a simple, tabular form transferred on the inputs of method: AHP, Electre Tri, econometric analysis and induction of decision rules. © 2015, Industrial Research Institute for Automation and Measurements.

 abstract = {Multiple criteria sorting aims at assigning alternatives evaluated on several criteria to predefined ordered categories. In this paper, we consider a well known multiple criteria sorting method, Electre Tri, which involves three types of preference parameters: (1) category limits defining the frontiers between consecutive categories, (2) weights and majority level specifying which coalitions form a majority, and (3) veto thresholds characterizing discordance effects. We propose an elicitation procedure to infer category limits from assignment examples provided by multiple decision makers. The procedure computes a set of category limits and vetoes common to all decision makers, with variable weights for each decision maker. Hence, the method helps reaching a consensus among decision makers on the category limits and veto thresholds, whereas finding a consensus on weights is left aside. The inference procedure is based on mixed integer linear programming and performs well even for datasets corresponding to real-world decision problems. We provide an illustrative example of the use of the method and analyze the performance of the proposed algorithms. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Evaluating and comparing the threats and vulnerabilities associated with territorial zones according to multiple criteria (industrial activity, population, etc.) can be a time-consuming task and often requires the participation of several experts and decision makers. Rather than a direct evaluation of these zones, building a risk evaluation scale and using it in a formal procedure permits to automate the assessment and therefore to apply it in a repeated way and in large-scale contexts and, provided the chosen procedure and scale are accepted, to make it objective. One of the main difficulty of building such a formal evaluation procedure is to account for the multiple experts knowledge and decision makers preferences. The procedure used in this article, ELECTRE TRI, uses the performances of each territorial zone onmultiple criteria, together with preferential parameters, to qualitatively assess their associated risk level. The preferential parameters to be determined are the category limits, i.e. the limits on each criterion of the performance range associated with a given risk level, and the weights associated with the different criteria. To obtain these parameters with no direct questioning of the stakeholders, tools based on mathematical programming have been developed to deduce these preferential parameters from assessment examples. In this article, several such tools are applied together in order to build a complete example leading to the definition of a territorial risk evaluation scale taking into account the preferences of multiple stakeholders. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.},

 abstract = {Various software tools implementing multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods have appeared over the last decades. Although MCDA methods share common features, most of the implementing software have been developed independently from scratch. Majority of the tools have a proprietary storage format and exchanging data among software is cumbersome. Common data exchange standard would be useful for an analyst wanting to apply different methods on the same problem. The Decision Deck project has proposed to build components implementing MCDA methods in a reusable and interchangeable manner. A key element in this scheme is the XMCDA standard, a proposal that aims to standardize an XML encoding of common structures appearing in MCDA models, such as criteria and performance evaluations. Although XMCDA allows to present most data structures for MCDA models, it almost completely lacks data integrity checks. In this paper we present a new comprehensive data model for MCDA problems, implemented as an XML schema. The data model includes types that are sufficient to represent multi-attribute value/utility models, ELECTRE III/TRI models, and their stochastic extensions, and AHP. We also discuss use of the data model in algorithmic MCDA. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

 abstract = {Many companies are engaged in increasing their productivity and improving the quality of their products and operations. A means to achieve such improvements is to adopt Business Process Management practices. Techniques to analyze, evaluate and improve business processes are deemed Business Process Modeling. Currently, there are several methodologies and techniques for modeling to choose from. The business process modeling method selected for modeling can directly impact on the result of BPM. Therefore, in order to help both academics and practitioners, a model is proposed that will sort business process modeling methods based on the objectives of modeling using the ELECTRE TRI method. This model can serve as a basis for evaluating modeling methods, and thus act as a guide for organizations and serve for a pre-analysis that may support future choice. We use a Product Development process in an automobile company as an example to demonstrate the model. ©2010 IEEE.},

 abstract = {In this paper a ranking method of urban intersections based on their hindering or facilitating effect on walking is proposed and tested on a sample of street crossings in the city of Alghero. The study investigates the effects of geometric and operational characteristics of urban intersections on pedestrian accessibility. Tthrough a detailed audit conducted on each node we collected a set of micro level data on the impact of intersections on wakability expressed by pedestrian: the comparison between objective and subjective information allowed to identify the most important influencing factors and their relative weight in the measure of walkability. Then we proceeded to classify intersections: the variety and diversity of attributes suggested the employment of a multicriteria ranking evaluative method: more precisely, we adapted the ELECTRE TRI rating method (Roy and Bouyssou, 1993) with the purpose of rating urban opportunities according to their influence on walking. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

 abstract = {Management of complex supply networks is a fundamental business topic today. Especially in the presence of many and diverse stakeholders, identifying and assessing those risks having a potential negative impact on the performance of supply processes is of utmost importance and, as a result, implementing focused risk management actions is a current lively field of research. The possibility of supporting Supply Chain Risks Management (SCRM) is herein explored from a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)-based perspective. The sorting method ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE) TRI is proposed as a structural procedure to classify Supply Chain Risks (SCRs) into proper risk classes expressing priority of intervention so as to ease the implementation of prevention and protection measures. This approach is intended to offer structured management insights by means of an immediate identification of the most highly critical risks in a wide set of previously identified SCRs. A real-world case study in the field of the automotive industry is implemented to show the applicability and usefulness of the approach. © 2021, Operational Research Society of India.},

 abstract = {Implementing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems is currently recognized as a best practice with wide associated possibilities of business improvement for companies. Integrating these kinds of systems with business processes in the most efficient way requires to endeavour as much as possible simplifications for final users, which can be pursued by optimizing crucial software characteristics. The present article proposes a novel Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach to deal with such an issue. Specifically, the ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) TRI technique is suggested to assign ERP modules into predefined and ordered categories according to maintainability and usability, which are useful drivers in evaluating which module of an ERP software should be enhanced with priority. The results prove to have whole beneficial impact on system performance with relation to a case study: improvement evaluations will be identified based on the classes the ERP modules are assigned to by the method. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

 abstract = {The aim of this paper is to compare sorting and ranking methods for prioritization of rehabilitation interventions of sewers, taking into account risk, performance and cost. For that purpose multiple criteria decision-aid (MCDA) methods such as ELECTRE TRI for sorting and ELECTRE III for ranking are applied in a real case-study and the results obtained are compared. The case study is a small sanitary sewer system from a Portuguese utility located in the metropolitan area of Lisbon. The problem to investigate is the prioritization of the sewer candidates for rehabilitation. The decision maker (a panel group of specialists) has chosen five assessment measures: water level and maximum flow velocity (hydraulic performance indices), sewer importance and failure repair cost (collapse-related consequences of failure) and the risk of collapse. The results show that the outcomes from ELECTRE III are easier to understand than those from ELECTRE TRI method. Two different sets of weights were used, and the sorting and ranking results from both methods were found to be sensitive to them. ELECTRE TRI method is not straightforward as it involves technical parameters that are difficult to de fine, such as reference profiles and cut levels. © IWA Publishing 2012.},

 abstract = {The paper aims to suggest a methodology able to support the analyst in the assessment process of items on the base of a criterion inspired to the maintainability parameter and in the successive assignment phase of the items in the predefined classes. The maintainability involves the continuous improvement of a system in order to improve the ability to maintain or improve the reliability of the analyzed system. In particular, the last one is the probability that a failed system will be restored to specified conditions within a given period of time when maintenance is performed according to prescribed procedures and resources. The faced case in this research regards the software maintenance, field in which the maintainability can be defined as the probability that a program will be restored to working conditions in a given period of time when it is being changed, modified or enhanced. Furthermore, the maintainability can be subdivided into diverse sub criteria as Analysability ( how easy or difficult is to diagnose the system for deficiencies or to identify the parts that need to be modified), Changeability (how easy or difficult is to make adaptations to the system), Stability (how easy or difficult is to keep the system in a consistent state during the modification process), Testability (how easy or difficult is it to test the system after modifications). Thus, with respect to aforementioned sub criteria the present research wants to propose the ELECTRE TRI method in order to assign the different analyzed items, with relation to the maintainability criterion, into the different predefined classes. With the aim to illustrate the method validity, a numerical application is shown with relation to the classification, under the maintainability criterion, of different modular Enterprise Resource Planning software systems.},

 abstract = {Project risk management plays a fundamental role in the project management field. Project objectives may dynamically change in time, hence it is not easy to satisfy them, especially when related to complex projects. In detail, they can be subjected to several and different risk conditions which have an important impact on the project success. In this context, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are effective tools to carry out the risk management. In particular, the present research proposes the use of MCDM with a specific focus on the ELECTRE TRI method. The last one is able to evaluate and assign projects under analysis into ordered and different risk classes. The purpose consists in extending the idea of the "probability and impact matrix" tool by adopting a multidimensional perspective. The proposed approach is applied to a case study related to an Oil & Gas project and a sensitivity analysis is shown to demonstrate the robustness of the results.},

 abstract = {Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is an engineering technique aimed at the detection of potential failures, their causes and consequences on the system/process under investigation. When used for the failure modes prioritization, FMEA is also referred to as Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). In traditional FMECA, risk priorities of failure modes are determined through the Risk Priority Number (RPN), which is a function of the three risk parameters Occurrence (O), Severity (S), and Detection (D). In the present paper, an alternative approach to the RPN is proposed for the criticality assessment of process/system failure modes. Particularly, the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method ELECTRE TRI is employed to assign failure modes to predefined and ordered risk classes, from the highest to the lowest risky one. Contrarily to the traditional RPN, the method allows the Decision Maker (DM) at taking into account the relative importance of risk parameters as well as his/her uncertainty in assigning each failure mode to a specific risk class. The ELECTRE TRI-based approach is implemented on the applicative case proposed by Kurt and Özilgen (2013) with reference to Turkish dairy manufacturing industries. A sensitivity analysis is finally performed in order to test the influence of the input parameters on the classification results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Selection of an automated inspection device for an explicit industrial application is one of the most challenging problems in the current manufacturing environment. It has become more and more complicated due to increasing complexity, advanced features and facilities that are endlessly being integrated into the devices by different manufacturers. Selection of inspection devices plays a significant role in a manufacturing system for cost effectiveness and improved productivity. This paper focuses on the application of a very popular Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) tool, i.e. ELimination and Et Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE) for solving an automated inspection device selection problem in a discrete manufacturing environment. Using a sample case study from the published literature, this paper attempts to show how different variants of the ELECTRE method, namely ELECTRE II, IS, III, IV and TRI can be suitably applied in choosing the most efficient alternative that accounts for both the decision maker's intervention and other technical elements. Using different ELECTRE methods, a list of all the possible choices from the best to the worst suitable devices is obtained while taking into account different selection attributes. The ranking performance of these methods is also compared with that of the past researchers. © IJTech 2014.},

 abstract = {Assessing the significance of environmental impacts is one of the most important and all together difficult processes of Environmental Impact Assessment. This is largely due to the multicriteria nature of the problem. To date, decision techniques used in the process suffer from two drawbacks, namely the problem of compensation and the problem of identification of the "exact boundary" between sub-ranges. This article discusses these issues and proposes a methodology for determining the significance of environmental impacts based on comparative and sensitivity analyses using the Electre TRI technique. An application of the methodology for the environmental assessment of a Power Plant project within the Valencian Region (Spain) is presented, and its performance evaluated. It is concluded that contrary to other techniques, Electre TRI automatically identifies those cases where allocation of significance categories is most difficult and, when combined with sensitivity analysis, offers greatest robustness in the face of variation in weights of the significance attributes. Likewise, this research demonstrates the efficacy of systematic comparison between Electre TRI and sum-based techniques, in the solution of assignment problems. The proposed methodology can therefore be regarded as a successful aid to the decision-maker, who will ultimately take the final decision. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Sorting methods, in particular ELECTRE Tri methods, are widely used in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding to deal with ordinal classification problems. Problems of this kind encountered in practice involve the evaluation of different alternatives (actions) on several evaluation criteria that are structured in a hierarchical way. In order to deal with a hierarchical structure of criteria in decision problems, Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process (MCHP) has been recently proposed. In this paper, we apply the MCHP to the ELECTRE-Tri methods. In particular, we extend ELECTRE Tri-B, ELECTRE Tri-C and ELECTRE Tri-nC methods. We also adapt the MCHP concept to the case where interaction among evaluation criteria has either strengthening, or weakening, or antagonistic effect. Finally, we present an extension of the SRF method to determine the weights of criteria in case they are hierarchically structured. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Usual approaches to identify costumer's perceptions about service are based on subjective evaluations under multiple criteria. Generally, an aggregation function based on weighted average method is used to solve this type of problem, in despite of the compensatory problems that it causes. Present work explores the application of an MCDM based method in order to solve this problem. An original approach to estimates p and q parameters in ELECTRE TRI is inserted on the model building, incorporating robustness to the proposal. Also, an original approach to incomparability's analyses is observed. An application of the proposal is experimented in a candy shop to evaluate consumer's satisfaction.},

 abstract = {This paper aims to present a multicriteria model for evaluating and classifying organizational performance with respect to the best practices in management. The proposed multicriteria model is based on the ELECTRE TRI method for obtaining degrees of credibility and ratings of organizational performance. An experimental study was conducted to investigate the application of the proposed model. Rating scales, based on Likert (1932), were used and a set of criteria was inspired by the following awards for management excellence: the Deming Prize, the Malcolm Baldridge Award, the National Quality Award and European Quality Award. As a result, it was possible to obtain a classification and to identify the criteria of excellence that should be prioritized to improve the classification achieved by an organization.},

 abstract = {Data centers (DCs) are complex organizational and technical infrastructures that assure the performance and reliability of modern information and communication systems. The high installation and operations costs of DCs and the stringent requirements regarding reliability and safety require close attention to the location of this type of facility. This paper proposes a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach for identifying the most interesting locations to install sustainable DCs, taking into account technical, social, economic, and environmental dimensions. For each of these main dimensions, the evaluation was formulated as a multicriteria sorting problem. These problems were analyzed using the outranking MCDA method ELECTRE TRI through the IRIS software, allowing for uncertainty about the criteria weights. The results are summarized in a graphical form, without attempting to reduce such incommensurable dimensions to a single value. © 2012 The Authors.

 abstract = {The size and capacity of Data Centers (DCs) is growing at a rapid pace to meet the increased demand of data processing and storage capacity requested by a digital information society. Since DCs are infrastructures that have large energy consumption, there is a need to change their design approach to make them more efficient and more environment friendly. This research was motivated by the planning of a new DC in Portugal. It proposes a multi-criteria framework to assess the sustainability of a DC, which includes a newmetric to evaluate the DC efficiency taking into account the environmental conditions of the DC location. ELECTRE TRI was chosen for aggregating different metrics concerning the environmental sustainability of a DC into sustainability categories. The evaluation methodology allows some freedom for each DC to place more weight on the aspects in which it is stronger, an analysis facilitated by the IRIS decision support system. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

 abstract = {Generally, experts use very large quantities of data during the analysis of civil works. These data are of four main types: visual observations, monitoring data, data calculated from models, and design and construction data. They are frequently "imperfect": they contain uncertainty, imprecision, incompleteness. These imperfections have various roots, for instance, material location and sampling, number of measurement instruments, maintenance, such as scraping downstream slope, and frequency of monitoring measurement, etc. The method proposed in this paper first permits the identification of the various sources of imperfection and their definition as criteria; second, it provides a reliable way of assessing these criteria; third, it applies the multicriteria analysis ELECTRE TRI method to aggregate the values resulting from the assessment of the criteria. Finally, corrective actions are proposed to maintain or replace the measurement system under standard operating conditions. The method was applied to a real-case study. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

 abstract = {This paper addresses the situation where a group wishes to cooperatively develop a common multicriteria evaluation model to sort actions (projects, candidates) into classes. It is based on an aggregation/disaggregation approach for the ELECTRE TRI method, implemented on the Decision Support System IRIS. We provide a methodology in which the group discusses how to sort some exemplary actions (possibly fictitious ones), instead of discussing what values the model parameters should take. This paper shows how IRIS may be used to help the group to iteratively reach an agreement on how to sort one or a few actions at a time, preserving the consistency of these sorting examples both at the individual level and at the collective level. The computation of information that may guide the discussion among the group members is also suggested. We provide an illustrative example and discuss some paths for future research motivated by this work. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Periodically, organizations need to change the quality management aspects of processes and products in order to suit the demands of their internal and external (consumer and competitor market) environments. In the context of the present study, quality management changes involve tools, programs, methods, standards and procedures that can be applied. The purpose of this study is to help senior management to identify types of change and, consequently, determine how it should be correctly conducted within an organization. The methodology involves a classification model, with multicriteria support, and three organizational change ratings were adopted (the extremes, type I and type II, as confirmed in the literature, and the intermediary, proposed herein). The multicriteria method used was ELECTRE TRI and the model was applied to two companies of the Textile Local Productive Arrangement in Pernambuco, Brazil. The results are interesting and show the consistency and coherence of the proposed classification model. © 2018 Production.},

 abstract = {With the advancement in autonomic computing technology, quality assurance for autonomic software is another big challenge to be faced by IT industries. Autonomic software is quite different in working compared to non-autonomic software. So, quality estimation parameters will also be different. Quality assurance method for autonomic software has not been standardized yet but quality parameters based on autonomic features have been suggested by researchers. Based on the functioning of autonomic software and autonomic capabilities, Autonomicity and Trustworthiness are considered to be the major quality estimation metrics. In this paper, trustworthiness estimation is performed using six attributes. To contribute in this area further, attributes are ranked based on the weights estimated using Electre-Tri multi-criteria outranking method. The attributes weights can be used further to estimate trustworthiness for any autonomic software. With this, the quality estimation task can also be processed for autonomic software. © 2020, © 2020 Taru Publications.},

This is a multi-criteria classification problem, in which classes are in the strict preference relation. The parameters are profiles, thresholds, weights, and cutting level; they are linked each other either directly or indirectly with mathematical relations. We propose a new procedure composed of two phases, taking into account that the core of the analysis is the profiles estimation made by linear programming problem. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

 abstract = {The performance evaluation of competencies is one of the most promising tools for assessing human capital in organizations. However, the analysis of multiple axes at the same time is complex and prone to error. The aim of this study is to propose the use of multicriteria support to aid the decision maker in evaluating competencies. To this end, the multicriteria method called ELECTRE TRI was used to analyze the competencies and accomplish classification of the employees. The competencies axes, Skills, Knowledge and Attitude (SKA) are used in the method as criteria while the evaluated employees were the "alternatives". A field study involving 91 employees working in Call Center Company of Pernambuco State (Brazil) was conducted. The results showed that it is possible to perform specific modeling for each type of function. In the groups of attendants, approximately 15% of workers demonstrated poor performance. Analogously, similar results were observed in 10% of managers. The model arises as a support in the processes of firing, hiring and training. © Medwell Journals, 2016.},

An application of the proposal has been made, catching the perceptions from students of a class of a Brazilian Professional Master's Degree Course in Production Engineering. The criteria set was first based on literature review and refined trough opinions from specialists. The participants of the research were asked about their perceptions on both: Importance degree of criteria and influence of the course over alumni's skill under each criterion viewpoint. The data collected were analyzed with the support of ELECTRE TRI and a sensibility analyses on the influence of the ELECTRE TRI's credibility degree cut-level was carried over the results and assignments.},

 abstract = {Spatial interpolation and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) capabilities of geographic information systems have the potential to create new approaches to forest management. In this study, the regularized spline with tension (RST) interpolation method and ELECTRE TRI MCDA was used to predict forest stand volumes in an area characterized by even-aged stands with heterogeneous structures in Turkey. Sampling data (1050 circular sample plots) were obtained from the National forest inventory. For each species and diameter class, a map of the predicted volume per ha was obtained using the RST method. By repeating the same process for the eight species occurring in the study area, 31 volume maps were produced. The accuracy of these prediction maps was assessed at pixel (20 x 20 m) and area scale (per ha). An accuracy of more than 97% was achieved at the pixel level, whereas a minimum accuracy of 86% was achieved for the area-based estimations. In addition, predicted values from the above 31 volume maps were compared with the observed values from management plan reports obtained from the Government Institute responsinble for forest management plans. The comparisons showed an accuracy of predictions of 21, 14, 4, and 2% for Calabrian pine, Oriental beech, black pine and oak species, respectively. Following interpolation, volume prediction maps were geo-computed, and a volume-based stand map was produced. The 890 different combinations of species composition and diameter classes were classified according to expert knowledge by the use of ELECTRE TRI MCDA, obtaining a final stand type map representing 70 different profile categories based on species mixture rates and diameter classes for the area analyzed. © iForest - Biogeosciences and Forestry.},

 abstract = {The aim of the following article is to study the process of innovation convergence amongst the Spanish Autonomous Regions. To this end the research has been based on the data analysis from the INE (Spanish National Institute of Statistics) Innovation surveys from 2005 to 2006. The methodology used will allow us to set up an Autonomous Regions Ranking per year, clustering per groups of innovation quality, so we could analyze the evolution of these rankings to reveal the existence of downward/upward trend changes during the period analyzed in the different Spanish Autonomous Regions. It will be set out having into consideration all the data and variables offered by the INE at Autonomous Region level on the enterprise technological innovation survey, so it will be analyzed among other variables the intensity of innovation, the number of innovative enterprises and the number of innovative SMEs. Those classifications will be obtained throughout the application of a non compensatory multicriteria methodology based on outranking relations: Electre Tri method. © ECMS.},

 abstract = {The increase in productivity is an obvious objective for business, moreover with the research and development objectives set out for Barcelona 2010 and the Lisbon Summit. Productivity is linked to efficiency as enterprises have increased productivity when they need less input to achieve certain outputs or when they increase outputs with the same inputs. The objective for this article is to analyze the innovation efficiency in Spain by activity branch. To this end we will work with the 2006 data from the INE (Spanish National Institute of Statistics) innovation and R&D activities surveys. To this aim, we will use the following methodology for the efficiency analysis: the one based on output oriented DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) with constant returns to scale. This technique will be completed in two aspects. Firstly with the introduction of more inputs and outputs without causing an increment of efficient units and, secondly the study will be completed with a robust analysis to improve the DEA discrimination capacity. © ECMS.},

 abstract = {Main decision-making problems can be described into choice, ranking or sorting of a set of alternatives or solutions. The principle of Electre TRI (ET) method is to sort alternatives ai according to criteria g j into categories C h whose lower and upper limits are respectively b h and b h+1. The sorting procedure is based on the evaluations of outranking relations based firstly on calculation of partial concordance and discordance indexes and secondly on global concordance and credibility indexes. In this paper, we propose to replace the calculation of the original concordance and discordance indexes of ET method by a more effective sigmoidal model. Such model is part of a new Belief Function ET (BF-ET) method under development and allows a comprehensive, elegant and continuous mathematical representation of degree of concordance, discordance and the uncertainty level which is not directly taken into account explicitly in the classical Electre Tri. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

 abstract = {Main decisions problems can be described into choice, ranking or sorting of a set of alternatives. The classical ELECTRE TRI (ET) method is a multicriteria-based outranking sorting method which allows to assign alternatives into a set of predetermined categories. ET method deals with situations where indifference is not transitive and solutions can sometimes appear uncomparable. ET suffers from two main drawbacks: 1) it requires an arbitrary choice of λ-cut step to perform the outranking of alternatives versus profiles of categories, and 2) an arbitrary choice of attitude for final assignment of alternatives into the categories. ET finally gives a final binary (hard) assignment of alternatives into categories. In this paper we develop a soft version of ET method based on belief functions which circumvents the aforementioned drawbacks of ET and allows to obtain both a soft (probabilistic) assignment of alternatives into categories and an indicator of the consistency of the soft solution. This Soft-ET approach is applied on a concrete example to show how it works and to compare it with the classical ET method. © 2012 ISIF (Intl Society of Information Fusi).},

 abstract = {The choice of suitable evaluation methods for the layered evaluation of Interactive Adaptive Systems (IAS) needs the consideration of different factors, leading to a multi-criteria decision analysis problem. This paper proposes the first step toward a Web-based Multi-Criteria Decision Support System (MCDSS). Our proposal is based on a recent multi-criteria decision method called ELECTRE TRI-B-H (Elimination and Choice Translating Reality) to guide the layered evaluation of IAS. The goal is to support the choice of appropriate evaluation methods for individual layers taking into account constraints of the layered evaluation and the individual layers. The appropriateness of each evaluation method is analyzed for the layered evaluation in general and each layer in particular. The use of ELECTRE TRI-B-H method allows decomposing a decision problem into intermediate sub-problems through a hierarchy model and sorting alternative evaluation methods at different levels of the hierarchy. A case study of an adaptive hypermedia system is presented; in this study, the ELECTRE TRI-B-H method has been applied to select the most suitable evaluation methods for each of its layers taking into account the layered evaluation context. The promising results show the feasibility of the proposed approach, leading to various research perspectives. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

 abstract = {The ELECTRE family of decision aid methods is a well-known approach to help decision makers (DMs) advance in a decision process. Among the most recent methods in the family, ELECTRE IS, III, and TRI compute fuzzy indices for the credibility of a given action outranking some other. We consider the case when the DMs are unsure which values each parameter should take, which may result from insufficient, imprecise or contradictory information, as well as from different preferences among a group of DMs. In the framework of a robustness analysis approach, where DMs provide only partial information on the parameter values (through constraints on acceptable combinations), we study how to find whether an outranking among two actions in an ELECTRE method is robust. In this context, we study the resulting nonlinear problems of optimizing a credibility index (under the type of constraints that we consider to appear in practice) and present some examples. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {This paper presents Interactive Robustness analysis and parameters’ Inference for multicriteria Sorting problems (IRIS), a Decision Support System (DSS) designed to sort actions (projects, candidates, alternatives, clients, etc.) described by their performances on multiple criteria into an ordered set of categories defined a priori. It is based on the ELECTRE TRI sorting method, but does not require the decision maker (DM) to indicate precise values for all of the method’s parameters. More realistically, the software expects the DM to indicate some constraints that these parameters should respect, including sorting examples that the program should reproduce. If the constraints indicated by the DM do not contradict each other (i.e. form a consistent system), then IRIS infers a combination of parameter values that reproduces all the sorting examples, indicating also the range of possible assignments of actions to categories that would be possible without violating any of the stated constraints. If the constraints are contradictory (i.e. form an inconsistent system), then IRIS suggests a combination of parameter values that minimizes an error function and identifies alternative ways to restore the system’s consistency by removing some constraints. © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {Outranking methods are a specific type of Multi-Criteria Decision Aiding methods. They are based on the construction of binary relations validating or invalidating, for any pair of alternatives (a, b), the assertion “a outranks b”. This comparison is grounded on the evaluation vectors of both alternatives, and on additional information concerning the decision maker’s preferences, typically accounting for two conditions: concordance and non-discordance. In decision processes using these methods, the analyst should interact with the decision maker in order to elicit values for the parameters that define a preference model. This can be done either directly or through a disaggregation procedure that infers parameter values from holistic judgements provided by the decision maker. In this chapter we discuss the elicitation of an outranking-based preference model, focusing on the valued outranking relation used in the ELECTRE III and ELECTRE TRI methods. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a new Human Development Index (HDI) classification method using as a basis the same dimensions and weights used by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), however, avoiding the compensatory effect and misclassification that can occur when UNDP approach is applied. The proposed approach also allows working with any set of dimensions and weights. The classification was performed by the Elimination Et Choix Traidusaint la Realite (ELECTRE TRI), a multicriteria method, in which classes were defined with the visual aid of a non-parametrically tool, the Kernel Density Estimation and the class profiles were calculated by the Jenks Natural Breaks algorithm. The proposed classification method achieved better results than the one adopted by the UNDP, because the countries could be classified accurately in their natural classes without occurring the compensation effect. However, when comparing with the HDI index we have obtained an accuracy of 76.60% for the first proposed model and 78.72% for the second one. Our proposal purely used the same dimensions and weights adopted by UNDP. The proposed method is more robust, closer to reality and can eliminate the compensatory effect between dimensions, thus it can provide more credibility to the HDI. The combination of the ELECTRE TRI method with statistical tools to define classes and class profiles for the HDI is unprecedented in the literature. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

 abstract = {Over the past two decades, the quantitative analysis of financial and banking decisions has gained significant interest among researchers and practitioners. A significant part of the research conducted in this field focused on the development of analytical models that can be used in evaluating the alternative ways of action in financial and banking problems. Typically, this evaluation involves the choice of the best alternative, the ranking of the alternatives from the best to the worst ones, or their classification into predefined homogenous classes. This paper is focused on the classification approach illustrating the use of multi–criteria decision aid (MCDA) classification methods in making financial and banking decisions. Three MCDA approaches (the UTADIS method, the ELECTRE TRI method, and the rough set approach) are applied in financial and banking problems, such as business failure prediction, credit–risk assessment, and portfolio selection and management. A comparison is also performed with linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, and logit analysis. International Federation of Operational Research Societies 2002.},

Often, however, their implementation is cumbersome, due to the large number of parameters that the decision maker must specify.

In this study, an evolutionary approach, based on the differential evolution algorithm, is proposed in the context of the ELECTRE TRI method.

 abstract = {Corporate credit ratings are widely used in financial services for risk management, investment, and financing decisions. In this study, the use of a recently developed multicriteria outranking approach, namely the ELECTRE TRI-NC method, is examined for constructing internal credit rating models in an expert-based judgmental framework. The models are constructed in a multicriteria classification (sorting) setting and the results are analyzed in terms of their internal properties as well as their deviations from risk rating categories defined by rating agencies (i.e. external benchmarking). A simulation/scenario analysis is conducted to examine the results and performance of the outranking models in relation to their parameters. Empirical results are provided for a sample of European firms rated by three leading rating agencies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Several stakeholders are increasingly interested in operational risks and their impact on key business projects such as outsourcing projects. To guide stakeholders and project managers to take decisions related to the outsourcing of one or multiple activities, we propose a decision support system for classifying organizational risks, as example of operational risks, into different risk categories. The classification system is based on a set of performance metrics that measure both the likelihood and impact criterias. Electre-Tri a formal multi-criteria decision analysis method, was used as the foundation for this task. This method allowed us to cluster various organizational risks in different risk categories based on our current knowledge of those risks, and based on the best professional judgments. A numerical application based on a real case is presented. © 2016 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Outsourcing functions such as logistics has become an industry trend towards cost-effectiveness and high service level performance. Many firms have acknowledged the benefits of relying on external experts in a need to empower their abilities. The pharmaceutical industry in particular is challenged by constant evolution of their development and manufacturing processes. Outsourcing logistics becomes then an attractive option for firms to focus on their core competencies. However, alongside the numerous benefits of outsourcing, various risks arise with the implementation of this option. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting a decision model that takes into consideration risks of outsourcing logistics in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Risk identification and a multi-criteria risk assessment model using ELECTRE TRI are described. © 2016},

 abstract = {Multicriteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) paradigm has been utilized in solving classification problems, as well as ranking and selection problems. MCDA classification methods are distinguished from the other ones because they allow the decision maker to intervene the model and have no statistical constraints. In this study, a novel MCDA classification method based on Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) is presented. The method, which is named GRA-TRI, allows defining a category by reference alternative and realize assignment by considering the mathematical and geometrical similarity in GRA. In the paper, firstly, the notations and assumptions of the method have been described. Then, an illustrative example was performed step by step. By comparing GRA-TRI and ELECTRE TRI-Central, it has been showed that GRA-TRI makes consistent and reasonable assignments. Hereby, an alternative method which is simple and comprehensible, and has the advantages of grey system theory, has been presented. © 2018 Research Information Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Patients with advanced hip osteoarthritis are likely to suffer from biomechanical disorders. As many criteria inform how such patients are being qualified for alloplasty procedures, this article proposes a multi-criteria decisional framework in qualifying patients for treatment while undergoing diagnostic analysis for hip replacement surgery. In order to assess the patient's health condition, the competence of physicians and physiotherapists must first be checked. After creating the expert preference model and decision tree, the AHP method was applied followed by the Electre Tri method in the next stage of verification. Integrating these analytic procedures, a group of patients can be quickly evaluated and meaningfully profiled. Specifically, these patients can be classified in respect of their condition determined during hospitalisation as per the severity of degenerative disease and on the basis of their subjective feelings and diagnostics. The proposed methodology promises to allow optimal treatment to be assigned while enabling the appropriate classification and verification within group of patients targeted for hip replacement surgery. © 2020 IGI Global.

 abstract = {Day after day, the importance of a company having an efficient storage location assignment system increases. Moreover, since products have different warehouse costs and customers' requirements are also different, it is important to sort products in order to adopt strategies for inventory management that are appropriate for each product. However, adopting a policy for each product is not applicable in the real world. Therefore, companies usually categorize products into classes and thereafter adopt specific inventory management policies. Given this situation, this paper puts forward the arguments for adopting a multi-criteria method, Electre TRI, to sort products that both considers criteria relating to the characteristics of a product as to its physical location in the warehouse and the criteria that are important for inventory strategies, such as, for example, the profitability of each unit held in storage. © 2013 Brazilian Operations Research Society.},

 abstract = {Even small improvements in storage operations can bring significant benefits in customer response time, increasing the level of service offered. However, a company cannot offer high level of service for all products. In this sense, one of the ways used to optimize the activities for order picking is the study of storage location assignment problem (SLAP). Thus, this paper proposed a multi-criteria decision model to perform the products classification and to solve the SLAP in a multi-layer warehouse. The ELECTRE TRI method is used to define the shelf level for each product, and the ELECTRE III method is used to establish a fixed location for each product on the shelf it belongs to. The great advantage of this model is that there is not trade-off among the criteria, and it is able to consider several criteria simultaneously. However, the main goal is not optimization, but the search for a storage operations performance balance, considering multiple criteria, allowing for a better inventory management when considering profitability criteria, for example, and improvement in the order picking operations, through the demand and space required criteria. In addition, it considers the preferences of the decision maker. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.},

 abstract = {A multi-criteria model tackled by an outranking method devoted to the sorting problem is presented to support decision making in assessing individual mental disabilities using information required in the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. This diagnosis process is a critical factor for adapting treatments to the current stage of the disease and improving health care and quality of life. The criteria required in the Clinical Dementia Rating scale have been considered as an input for developing our multi-criteria model, the output of which is the classification of each individual under evaluation in a pre-defined ordered class (category) as an indicator of the revealed level of mental disabilities. A method based on the exploitation of an outranking relation for the sorting problem is used to compare the individual information according to multiple evaluation criteria with reference profiles (specified standards) that define the boundaries of the classes. This methodological approach is substantially different from the ones based on the aggregation of the different criteria using weighted-sums to produce a "common value" measure. The method requires meaningful technical parameters, such as weights (herein perceived as true importance coefficients of the multiple evaluation aspects), distinct thresholds to ascertain the outranking classification, and a cutting level establishing the exigency of the classification. A realistic example using the decision support system Iris is presented to illustrate the results.},

 abstract = {The recent figures of education in Brazil reveal poor student performance in primary and secondary education, which are the foundation of higher education. This scenario was the main motivation for the development of the exploratory approach presented in this article. Based on dimensions and criteria present in scientific studies and on the use of a method of decision support (ELECTRE TRI) and Quartiles analysis, the proposed approach aimed to evaluate and rank the quality of an institution of secondary education, according to the perceptions of faculty and students. Through a study carried out in a campus of a Federal Institute of Technology Education, Cronbach's alpha coefficient (1951) was used to measure the reliability of the questionnaires, and the Quartiles analysis was used to determine the most critical items. The results indicate that the questionnaires are valid and reliable. The learning deficit accumulated by students at previous levels of education, lack of interest in participating in classes and in deeply understanding the content of disciplines, as well as lack of homework completion are some critical items perceived by teachers. On the other hand, lack of clarity in the explanation of content of disciplines, lack of control of the class and the frequency of use of laboratories and audiovisual resources are some of the most critical items perceived by students. In developing this exploratory approach to the evaluation and diagnosis of secondary education institutes, we hope to contribute with the managers of such institutions so that precise actions to improve the quality of secondary education can be planned and carried out by official bodies.},

 abstract = {The introduction of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 represents a very important step in the effort for the limitation of the emissions of greenhouse gases. The energy sector, being responsible for the large majority of emissions, represents the most crucial field for undertaking mitigation actions. A large number of potential emission reduction measures exist in this sector, characterised by different cost, applicability difficulties, environmental and social impacts. These criteria define the degree of acceptance of the various actors involved in the decision-making process. In this paper, the possibilities offered by a multicriteria method - namely ELECTRE Tri - are investigated through its application in the case study of Greece, in order to define national priorities for a National Action Plan for GHG mitigation in the energy sector and to formulate a relevant time-schedule for actions' implementation. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

 abstract = {The ideal configuration of wastewater treatment system (WTS) for attending cities specificities has become a complex decision, due to the fact that there are several available technologies, and a diversity of characteristics presented in the scenario of each city. Considering the importance of economic analysis, especially in developing countries, this work aims to demonstrate the economic feasibility considering cost-related indicators for the ideal WTS selection for specific features in these cities. Based on a literature review, 37 main WTS and two economic cost-related indicators (Net Present Value and Annualized Net Present Value) were considered. First of all, using a multicriteria analysis these WTS were grouped in classes using the ELECTRE TRI method, based on criteria related to efficiency, and the weights were defined by appointments from research specialists in the literature appointments. The economic analysis was performed using the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method, which has been applied specifically to each WTS class, thus generating a framework of economic viability for this context. The WTS with low and high costs were appointed, considering the development level in each applied scenario. This work contributes to expanding the WTS study horizons to select an ideal system, considering the economic aspect. © IWA Publishing 2018.},

 abstract = {The present research aims to propose a Supplier Selection Model that creates collaborative relationships in Supply Chains, so that suppliers can be previously categorized into the cooperation, the coordination and the collaboration levels. Applied, quantitative, exploratory and descriptive research methods were used. A bibliographical research, a questionnaire, and the quantitative modeling were adopted as methodological procedures. The managers responsible for the Supplier Selection process in the Brazilian Wind Energy companies participated in this research. First, a criteria framework for the Selection of Supplier of goods and services was developed. Second, a Multicriteria Decision Aiding Model was created and validated, enabling the classification of the suppliers according to the relationship levels in a systematic way in terms of their performance from a set of criteria by implementing the ELECTRE TRI method. Firms can use the Model periodically in order to revise the supplier assessment and, if needed, direct them to either an inferior or superior class. © 2021 Brazilian Operations Research Society.},

 abstract = {Many companies today have embraced the concept of risk management, usually in the form of enterprise risk management or supply chain risk management. Both are based on a holistic view of risks. Hence, risks related to specific functions within a company must be considered more broadly than previously. Risks, however, involve uncertainty, and the less specific the context in which risks are viewed, the more uncertainty will be involved. One particular way to express uncertainty is through trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TrIFNs). In this paper, risks that are relevant for supplier risk assessments are first collected from the literature. Then it is illustrated how the multi-criteria decision analysis method ELECTRE TRI-C can be used for sorting suppliers into risk categories, when the risks as well as some of the method's parameters are expressed with TrIFNs. In order to do this, we make use of a small modification of an existing method for converting TrIFNs into crisp values. The approach is illustrated in a case problem based on a company that is looking for service providers (suppliers) of electrical maintenance. The problem involves 20 suppliers that are sorted into three risk categories based on evaluations from 27 criteria. Results from the case study point to two low risk suppliers. A further ad-hoc analysis suggests one of these to be less risky than the other. © 2016 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Maintaining relationships with suppliers has become a critical strategic management issue to business. As a consequence, the tasks of evaluating and selecting suppliers are essential, given that companies delegate part of their business to partners. The main purpose of these tasks is to identify suppliers with the highest potential for meeting a buyer's needs consistently and at an acceptable overall performance. However these tasks are complex since they involve a variety of conflicting criteria, which makes the problem one that can be tackled by an multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) approach. Moreover, companies have suppliers whose features and performance are different and buyers need to decide at each level how they may best collaborate with each type of supplier. Many papers in the literature have addressed this situation involving supplier selection; nevertheless, most of them present methods to solve ranking and choice problems. The objective of this paper is to propose a model for the strategic management of suppliers which uses the ELECTRE TRI method to sort suppliers into classes of collaboration. Therefore, by using this model it is possible for companies to do so in order to define the most appropriate strategies to adopt for each category. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

We propose a multi-criteria model to support supplier selection process, whereby suppliers are allocated to classes based on sustainability, integrating the opinions of customers and managers. The model has three phases: i) criteria definition, in which the Copeland method is used to aggregate criteria reported in the literature for a group of decision makers (customers and expert managers); ii) elicitation of the perceptions of decision-makers, about criteria and the definition of weights for these criteria using the AHP method, and iii) multi-criteria classification of suppliers performed using the ELECTRE-TRI method. A numerical application was performed in the textile sector in order to test results. The main results show that suppliers can be classified, balancing social, environmental and economic criteria and related ethical issues, considering opinions from customers and experts. The theoretical implications can benefit researchers who can apply the model in future research into economic, environmental and social interactions. Managers can use the structure presented in this model to improve supplier selection. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

To this end we will work with the 2009 data from the INE (Spanish National Institute of Statistics) innovation and R&D activities surveys. To this aim, we will use the following methodology for the efficiency analysis: the one based on output oriented DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) with constant returns to scale and weight restrictions. This technique will be completed in three aspects. Firstly with the introduction of more inputs and outputs without causing an increment of efficient units. Secondly, we will use the Principal Component Analysis to extract the idea to implement the weight restrictions in the DEA. Thirdly, the analysis will be completed with a robustness Analysis of the efficient activity branches to improve the DEA discrimination capacity. © ECMS Klaus G.

 abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide to the entrepreneurs, and propose to the scientific community, a newly structured knowledge system that includes the quality of customers and suppliers, to facilitate learning processes about the current state of the enterprise and new strategic approaches. Design/methodology/approach: The knowledge system is elaborated combining a long day-by-day experience in a specific Italian field [the independent after market (IAM)] with the theoretical knowledge of both economic and financial issues and multiple criteria (MC) methods of decision aid. The economic and financial key performance indicators are generated ad hoc for a specific sector and created with the concept that a company is in the center of a network composed of its suppliers, customers, competitors and the State. An MC model easily and consistently includes aspects that are different in terms of source and formal language. An MC method transparently synthesizes all these elements in relation to a specific decision problem. Integrating the potential of MC models and methods with economic and financial issues and context experience facilitates an effective knowledge transfer to the operators of the sector. Findings: This methodology is oriented to the companies involved in the IAM and in particular to the manufacture, distributor and spare parts dealer categories (in Italy, almost 500 manufacturers, 150 distributors and 5,000 dealers). Manufacturers can use the methodology and its results to know the economic and financial performances of their customers, distributors can identify their strengths and weaknesses and the situation of their competitors and dealers can identify the most reliable future partners. Also, foreign manufacturers may be interested in this analysis, before selling in Italy, and banks and financiers could consult our knowledge frameworks to analyze the risk default. Originality/value: The added value of this approach is to allow even small and medium enterprises, without an internal know-how for economic analyses, to use tools that clarify their relations with the interested parties of the macroeconomic system and facilitate the quality assessment of their portfolio of customers/suppliers. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {Territorial decision problems have a spatial complex nature which is also multidimensional, interdisciplinary, poorly defined and requiring the definition of several criteria with dissimilar importance. These types of problem involve many decision makers (individuals and institutions), with conflicting interests, preferences and points of view. In the current study, our contribution focuses on the design and development of a multicriteria spatial group decision support system to conduct the spatial localization process in Territory Planning: the problem that involves finding a surface that best meets certain criteria from a set of variants (the location of infrastructure: shopping center, hospital, school, . . . ). The suggested system SIGMAS allows taking into account both the spatial dimension as well as specific and divergent interests of different decision makers to reach an acceptable agreement. In this context, the proposed SGDSS is based on the coupling of two representations of reality: Multi Agent Systems (MAS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).We endow the MAS with a negotiation protocol based on mediation, featuring a coordinator agent responsible for the smooth conduct of negotiation and a set of participant agents representing different decision makers impacted by the decision in TP. This protocol exploits, also, multicriteria analysis methods namely ELECTRE III and ELECTRE TRI. © 2016 IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {In the present study, the authors propose a group decision support system (Web-GDSS), which allows multi-agents systems and multicriteria analysis systems to help decision-makers in order to obtain a collective decision, using web services. The proposed system operates on two main stages. First, decision-makers are in a different location away from each other. They must store their location in databases and invoke the appropriate web service. Second, in the case of negotiation between decision-makers, monotonic concession protocol will lead to an agreement using CONDORCET and BORDA voting methods. © 2019, IGI Global.

 abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a model to guide organizations according to the relative importance of customer's satisfaction about six quality service dimensions: reliability, empathy, assurance, tangibility, responsiveness (Parasuraman et al., 1985) and price. Design/methodology/approach: The present study uses SERVPERF customer requirements and weights of ELECTRE TRI multicriteria method to provide guidance on an appropriated action plan. Subsequently, it was demonstrated how the proposed model applied to the Inn. Findings: SERVPERF is based on the subjective and cognitive perception of customer's service analyses. ELECTRE TRI decreases the deviation of subjectivity and develops manager's energy flow, focussed on enterprise resources. Research limitations/implications: Measuring quality is hard work and usually the customer perceptions are not well understood, because it changes many times. In addition SERVPERF and ELECTRE TRI weights do not order the quality importance. Practical implications: Together, SERVPERF and ELECTRE TRI allow managers to prioritize the service level desired by the customer. Originality/value: The importance of this analysis follows the competitiveness approach: productivity, quality and flexibility (Boljwin and Kumpe, 1990). The paper develops an approach to lead organizational quality performance based on the customer view. It provides a sustainable competitive advantage. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {Land-use planners often make complex decisions within a short period of time when they must take into account sustainable development and economic competitiveness. A set of land-use suitability maps would be very useful in this respect. Ideally, these maps should incorporate complex criteria integrating several stakeholders' points of view. To illustrate the feasibility of this approach, a land suitability map for housing was realised for a small region of Switzerland. Geographical Information System technology was used to assess the criteria requested to define the suitability of land for housing. An example dealing with the evaluation of noise levels illustrates the initial steps of this procedure. Because the required criteria are heterogeneous and measured on various scales, an out-ranking multicriteria analysis method called ELECTRE-TRI was used. However, using it to assess the suitability of any point in a territory was impractical due to computational limitations. Therefore, a mathematical function to evaluate closeness relationships and classify the study area into homogeneous zones was used. This function is compatible with the outranking function of ELECTRE-TRI used to assess the suitability index. The resulting maps lend efficient support to negotiation and are very useful in dealing with inherent conflicts in land-use planning.},

 abstract = {This study was undertaken on the basis of reports from international research literature, which indicates that although investments in innovation have a higher return, compared to conventional investments, any relevant information concerning those investments is not distinctly (or clearly) reported on financial statements. The absence of information regarding such investments underlines the inadequacy of financial reporting. In fact, the apparent substitution of official financial statements for other unofficial documents, perhaps even derived from unsafe sources, indicates the negative effects this absence causes on market efficiency. The consequence could be more serious to those investors that are not in the position to seek and use alternative information sources, efficiently. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficiency of the Electre Tri method in developing models for identifying innovative firms. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of assigning alternatives evaluated on several criteria into ordered categories C1, C2,..., C p. This problem is known as the multi-criteria sorting problem and arises in many situations such as classifying countries into different risk levels based on economical and socio-political criteria, evaluating credit applications of bank customers. We are interested in sorting methods that are grounded on the construction of outranking relations. Among these, the Electre Tri method requires defining multidimensional profiles that represent the "frontier" separating consecutive categories Ch and C h+1, and assigns an alternative to categories according to how it compares to each of the profiles. The explicit specification of the profiles of consecutive categories can be difficult for decision makers. We develop a new outranking based sorting method that does not require the explicit definition of profiles. We instead require the decision maker to assign a subset of reference alternatives to the categories. To assign the remaining alternatives, each such alternative is compared to reference alternatives, and assigned to categories accordingly. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

 abstract = {Ethereum smart contract system has seen a steady adoption as it continues to support tens of thousands of contracts. This feature has evolved to give a practical shape to the ideas leading up to fractional ownership transfer, using advanced smart contracts such as ERC-981. However, alongside its numerous benefits, various risks arise with the actual implementation of the ERC-981. This paper documents high-level processes and risk factors involved in the transfer-system, building a theoretical risk model based on Electre Tri-framework belonging to MCDA classification/sorting models. This model deals with detecting problems that are pre-defined on a central reference. The approach is illustrated through several stages: following comparison between the methods of risk analysis towards a risk assessment model, proposing recommendations and solutions. The framework was able to detect 18 major risks and bugs assigned to 6 categories. © 2020 ASTES Publishers. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {This article provides an overview of a multicriteria decision support methodology for annual rehabilitation programs of water networks. A first set of criteria is formulated for the purpose of comparing and ranking rehabilitation projects. Each proposed criterion is a measure of a particular impact of the condition of a pipe. The ELECTRE TRI method is implemented for defining rehabilitation priorities. Two reference profiles are used to define the limits of three categories associated with three increasing priority levels. With these two reference profiles, applying the ELECTRE TRI method to an asset stock (a set of pipes that are candidates for rehabilitation) means assigning each pipe to one of six possible priority groups. A second set of criteria, based on the concept of efficiency, is proposed for comparing alternative rehabilitation programs (subsets of the asset stock). © 2007 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.},

 abstract = {Multicriteria sorting methods aim at assigning alternatives to one of the predefined ordered categories. We consider a sorting method in which categories are defined by profiles separating consecutive categories. An alternative a is assigned to the lowest category for which a is at least as good as the lower profile of this category, for a majority of weighted criteria. This method, that we call MR-Sort, corresponds to a simplified version of ELECTRE Tri. To elicit the values for the profiles and weights, we consider a learning procedure. This procedure relies on a set of known assignment examples to find parameters compatible with these assignments. This is done using mathematical programming techniques. The focus of this study is experimental. In order to test the mathematical formulation and the parameters learning method, we generate random samples of simulated alternatives. We perform experiments in view of answering the following questions: (a) assuming the learning set is generated using a MR-Sort model, is the learning method able to restore the original sorting model? (b) is the learning method able to do so even when the learning set contains errors? (c) is MR-Sort model able to represent a learning set generated with another sorting method, i.e. can the models be discriminated on an empirical basis? © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

 abstract = {An alternative approach to the formal management strategy of tropical timber species from the Congo Basin was investigated. It focused on the development of glulam, with an aim to specify a decision support model for the valorisation of tropical timber species considered for use in these products. There were 76 forest species analysed regarding ecological, engineering and social criteria according to their major uses. The Electre TRI-B multicriteria sorting method was used. The main result was a new and robust classification tool of timber species from the Congo Basin, corresponding to their multicriteria consensus degree. The potentials of the new grouping system were analysed. Species that meet a great majority of criteria were identified. They were highly suitable for sustaining the market position of glulam products. Implementing this strategy may significantly improve the management and increase the value of the timber species from the Congo Basin, while preserving endangered species. © 2018, © 2018 NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

 abstract = {The chapter presents a model for the design of an electric car sharing service for the city of Milan. Several options of service configurations have been analyzed and evaluated according to indicators measuring the performance of such options in respect to relevant dimensions (i.e. economic and financial costs and revenues, mobility, social benefits and environmental effects). We set up a multi-criteria assessment, structured by means of cognitive maps. Causal networks to estimate the effects of the options have been identified and instantiated by means of simulation techniques and other qualitative and quantitative models. The focus of the chapter is on the development and use of the causal maps and their integration with a multi-criteria assessment, based on the ELECTRE TRI rating method. The use of cognitive maps allowed to us capture the multiple values of the problem and the value trees of stakeholders' objectives. The proposed method can be useful for design of mobility services, especially at a strategic level. © ISTE Ltd 2016. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {A growing interest is expressed by organizations for the development of approaches enabling to take advantage of past experiences to improve their decision processes; they may be referred to as Lessons Learned (LL) processes. Within the LL processes implementation framework, the development of semi-automatic approaches able to distinguish criteria having major influence on the evaluation of experiences is crucial for identifying relevant recommendations and performing efficient prescriptive analysis. In this paper, we propose to contribute to LL study by focusing on the definition of an approach enabling, in a specific setting, to identify the criteria most influencing the decision process regarding the overall performance evaluation of a reduced set of experiences. The proposed approach is framed on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, and specifically is based on the Electre tri method. In this paper, an illustration of the proposed approach is provided studying the evaluation of logistical response strategies in humanitarian emergency situations. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

 abstract = {For half a century, the significant development of intensive farming has led to a massive use of products such as pesticides. The excessive use of these substances has contaminated surface water and groundwater. Some drinking water extraction points have also had to be abandoned. Around 30 years ago, in the southwest of France, a group of farmers decided to improve their farming methods, as well as developing new best environmental practices, such as grass strips along streams and riparian forests. By combining ELECTRE TRI-C, a sorting multi-criteria model, with a GIS, we were able to assign each farming parcel to one of the five levels of risk associated with surface water pesticide contamination. We also assessed the effectiveness of best environmental practices, and found that their use led to a reduction in the risk of pesticide transfer. This methodology re-enforces decision support tools for both water resource managers and agricultural and environmental stakeholders. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

 abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a multi-criteria classification approach for identifying world climates that are favourable to light tourism. We use a multi-criteria aggregation method, Electre Tri-nC, to assign over 60000 world locations to one of four climate categories ranging from unfavourable to ideal. The motivations behind this work are to remedy to some of the methodological problems in composite indices such as the Tourism Climatic Index, where a weighted sum is computed using ordinal data. We present our results for the summer month of August on the basis of the years 1961-1990 derived from the CRU CL 1.0 climate database of New et al. (1999). In addition to being theoretically sound, our approach uses the original, virtually untransformed, continuous data thereby avoiding loss of information. It also minimizes the compensation effects and makes it possible to take into account additional criteria to cater to various tourism contexts with various decision maker profiles. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {In this paper, ELECTRE-TRI method has been used for ranking the optimal solutions of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) which has been developed for multi-objective operation optimization of a cascade system of reservoirs. In the multi-objective optimization model, flood control and water supply have been considered as short-term and long-term objectives, respectively. The flood control objective function has been formulated to minimize the expected flood damages in different flooding months. A short-term reservoir optimization model which provides the optimal hourly releases during floods has been developed and linked to a flood damage estimation model. The water supply objective function minimizes water deficit damages in agricultural areas. The losses associated with deficit in supplying agricultural water demands have been calculated based on crop yield responses to deficit irrigation. Selection of the most practical solution among the optimal Pareto set of solutions, which is addressed using ELECTRE-TRI method, is a challenging issue. The proposed methodology provides an opportunity for further incorporation of decision makers' preferences in ranking the NSGA-II optimal set of solutions. The results of applying the developed models to the cascade system of the Dez and Bakhtiari Reservoirs in southwest of Iran show that ELECTRE-TRI method has the ability to rank the non-dominated solutions of the multi-objective operation optimization model and provides a suitable framework for considering the preferences of decision makers (DMs). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {The European policy target of substantially increasing the share of renewable energy in electricity generation, in combination with national subsidization support schemes, has strongly motivated private investors towards this business sector. In Greece, this interest is particularly apparent in the case of wind energy exploitation, due to a favourable legislative framework and the important wind potential available in several Greek regions. In such endowed regions, a very high number of applications were submitted to the competent authority, most of which compete for the same most attractive (windy) sites. The selection among these applications is a multicriteria problem that has been solved with the support of a Decision-Aid tool combining the multicriteria classification method ELECTRE-TRI with Integer Linear Programming. The developed approach takes into account both, the performances of the applications to the evaluation criteria, as well as a number of technical and policy constraints.},

 abstract = {Multiple Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) aims at helping a Decision Maker (DM) in the representation of his preferences over a set of alternatives, on the basis of several criteria which are often contradictory. In addition to the presence of a DM, MCDA process requires a specification of criteria, alternatives and preferential information given by the DM. Hence many methods have been developed in order to solve MCDA problems (ELECTRE methods, AHP, etc.). The interconnexion between MCDA and risk analysis has been proved. MCDA methods can be used to solve risk analysis problems such as: • Computation of a risk scale: it can be done by using MCDA methods as ELECTRE TRI or by MACBETH methodology when the scale is quantitative; • The evaluation of remediation solutions after an accident. We present in this paper the Decision Deck (DD) project (http://www.decision-deck.org/) which aims at collaboratively developing Open Source software tools implementing MCDA. These tools constitute an open source platform available for all communities, not only for MCDA community. We show how MCDA methods implemented in Decision Deck can be useful for risk analysis, especially in risk assessment and remediation risk management. Thus, Decision Deck can be interpreted as a bridge between MCDA and riskanalysis. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.},

 abstract = {The model-based design of virtual fruit ideotypes using multi-objective optimisation algorithms could produce a high number of contrasted fruits. The breeder (decision-maker) will need an automatic tool allowing him/her to sort these contrasted ideotypes into predefined categories corresponding to several targeted traits. This paper aims to develop such a decision-making module to sort a set of fruit ideotypes into one of five preference-ordered categories in the context of brown rot-peach fruit pathosystem. First, a set of ideotypes with contrasted trade-off between three criteria was produced using multi-objective optimisation algorithms. Then, two multi-criteria decision-making methods (ELECTRE-Tri and DRSA: dominance-based rough set approach) were tested in order to reproduce the classification made by the decision-maker. Such a non-typical classification seemed difficult to be reproduced by the ELECTRE-TRI method while the decision rule-based method gave very good results (only 10% wrong assignments). The proposed decision-making tool is very useful to speed-up the model-based design of fruit ideotypes, i.e., breeding. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

 abstract = {Due to constant decrease in farmlands, it is important to identify the best lands useful for sustainable agriculture (productive and profitable agriculture that protects the environment and that is socially equitable). This requirement has resulted in the development of land suitability maps for agriculture by combining several factors of various natures and of differing importance. The integration of MultiCriteria Decision Analysis approaches (MCDA) in a Geographical Information System (GIS) provides a powerful spatial decision support system which offers the opportunity to efficiently produce these land suitability maps. Indeed, GIS is a powerful tool for analyzing spatial data and establishing a process for decision support. Because of their spatial aggregation functions, MCDA methods can facilitate decision making in situations where several solutions are available, various criteria have to be taken into account and decision-makers are in conflict (Dias et al., 2002). The parameters and the classification system used in this work are inspired from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) approach dedicated to a sustainable agriculture. A spatial decision support system has been developed for establishing the land suitability map for agriculture. It incorporates the multicriteria analysis method ELECTRE Tri (ELimitation Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) in a GIS (ArcGIS) within the GIS program package environment. This approach has been tested on the area of Mleta in Algeria. A land suitability map for durum wheat has been produced. Through the obtained results, it appears that ELECTRE Tri method, integrated into ArcGIS 9.2 of ESRI, is better suited to the problem of land suitability for agriculture. The time saving during the development of the land suitability map for the agriculture of the durum wheat was considerable. The coherence of the obtained maps confirms the system effectiveness. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Combinations between ArcGIS and multicriteria analysis methods in this case Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la Realité (ELECTRE TRI) and a version of the weighted sum method simple additive weighting, applicable to the vector data model, have been established. The parameters and the classification system of Food and Agriculture Organization are used in this work. This approach has been tested on the area of Mleta in Algeria. Land suitability maps for durum wheat have been produced. Through the comparison between results obtained by these two methods and those available in a classical method, based on manual overlay procedures, it appears that optimistic procedure of the ELECTRE TRI method is better suited to the problem of land suitability for agriculture. © 2013 Saudi Society for Geosciences.},

 abstract = {In order to facilitate the decision making in spatial applications, several methods are available to aggregate the performance of decision-makers. The multitude of these methods makes it difficult to choose one method over another. Two main types of methods are used, the outranking methods which are based on bottom-up approach and the hierarchical analysis methods which are based on top-down approach. These methods can be adapted to this kind of applications and can be integrated into GIS which is an essential tool in spatial management and decision making. Methods developed according to the first approach are different from those developed in accordance with the second one. This study aims to present a comparison between two multicriteria decision-making methods ELECTRE (Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) Tri and AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) to assess land suitability for agriculture. Twelve criteria [water reserve easily utilizable, drainage, permeability, potential of hydrogen (pH), electrical conductivity, active limestone, cation exchange capacity, soil texture, soil useful depth, slope, availability of labor, proximity (roads)] grouped in five factors (agronomic, planning, land enhancement and improvement, soil conservation and environment protection, and socioeconomic conditions) were used in this study. An application has been carried out on the area of Mleta in Algeria. Two land suitability maps for durum wheat have been produced by the two procedures (optimistic and pessimistic) available in ELECTRE Tri, and another map has been obtained by AHP. After the comparison between the obtained results, it was apparent that ELECTRE Tri is more appropriate for the land suitability assessment for agriculture despite its complexity given the large number of required parameters. The subjective parameters available in ELECTRE Tri make it possible to take into account imprecise data. Another advantage of this method lies in the way of the decision-makers' preferences aggregation and the assignment of the land units to classes of predefined categories. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

 abstract = {In case of an accident concerning a nuclear installation, two intervention phases are distinguished: An emergency phase which calls for a rapid and organized response through intervention plans, and a post-accidental phase in which postponed actions are carried out on medium and/or long-term so that the situation comes back to a state judged as acceptable by stakeholders. The PRIME project has developed a decision aiding tool for risk managers involved in an industrial accident involving radioactive substances, through the evaluation of radio-ecological sensitivity of a territory in a post-accidental phase. The proposed decision aiding tool is grounded on the integration of Multiple Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) and a Geographical Information System (GIS). The proposed methodology relies on the concept of decision map which corresponds to a planar subdivision of the territory in which each subdivision is evaluated on the basis of several criterion maps. This results in a set of disjoint spatial units evaluated on an ordinal scale using the ELECTRE TRI method. Hence, the result is a decision map representing the radio-ecological sensitivity of the territory; such maps prove to be very useful for stakeholders to design relevant post-accidental strategies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

 abstract = {This work is concerned with land use assessment in a region of Burkina Faso, Western Africa. It can help to support the definition of politics promoting a sustainable development of the region. A spatial decision support model is built, based on a coupling of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) on the one hand and a Geographic Information System (GIS) on the other hand. The ELECTRE TRI method is used to sort the spatial units to ordered categories corresponding to various levels of response to the risk of landscape degradation. The model allows to aggregate physical, economical, socio-cultural and environmental aspects interpreted in terms of their impact on landscape preservation or degradation. Such a categorization leads to the determination of homogeneous zones in the region under study. It can possibly serve as a basis for allocating resources to the most promising sub-regions or the zones needing an urgent intervention. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

 abstract = {Efficiency and effectiveness of logistic activities, in general, and of distribution networks, in particular, are largely influenced by the way warehouses operate as nodes of these networks. In recent years, warehouse management has undergone major changes due to the increase of e-commerce and competition in time-reduction. Despite that, logistic costs of warehouse processes (e.g. receiving, storage, order picking and shipping, etc.) are still often high. Referring to the order picking process, related activities may be optimized by a proper assignment of products to storage locations. In the literature, this problem is known as Storage Location Assignment Problem (SLAP). Due to the multi-criteria nature of SLAP, a combined ELECTRE TRI and TOPSIS based approach under an uncertain environment is designed in the present paper. Aiming at properly dealing with the uncertainty of the decision process, an interval extension of both ELECTRE TRI and TOPSIS is proposed. Therefore, ELECTRE TRI is firstly used to assign products to shelf levels whereas TOPSIS is afterwards applied to determine their storage locations within every level rather than using a random assignment policy. The whole methodology has been designed in cooperation with a Sicilian company that provides logistic services all over the Italian territory. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {In recent years, the partnerships between private companies and public organizations are becoming key elements for improving local development, territorial competitiveness, and delivering innovation. These collaborations are widely promoted by the European Framework Programme for Research and Innovation thanks to the provision of several instruments, such as Horizon 2020. In this context, competitiveness’s improvement of the territory employing research and innovation actions is supported by the technological districts. In Sicily, the AgroBioPesca district has attempted a strategic action named “Call for ideas” in order to design its own roadmap for research and innovation in the agri-food sector. For this purpose, many proponents of public and/or private sectors presented several innovative project ideas referred to specific Technological Trajectories. This paper aims at providing an instrument able to select the most suitable project ideas in order to constitute the AgroBioPesca projects portfolio. To such an aim, the authors propose the application of the multiple criteria sorting method ELECTRE TRI considering criteria deduced by the Horizon 2020 guidelines and documents. The application of this methodology allows subdividing the project ideas received into project ideas to be rejected, reviewable, and eligible for funding. Moreover, to consider the uncertainty of the decision-makers’ judgment, the authors propose a new version of the method in which the crisp judgment is converted into an interval. A sensitivity analysis has lastly been conducted to study the weaknesses of non-financiable projects. © 2019 Editora Mundos Sociais. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Despite the diversity of advanced approaches, the concept of ‘financial integration’ couldn’t be explicitly analyzed. Indeed, empirical studies have shown that the measures of international financial integration are one-dimensional analysis. Due to the ambiguity of the concept and its multiple determinants, it must be analyzed in multidimensional levels. The interest of this research is a proposal of a decision aid by a multicriteria approach (ELECTRE TRI) for determining the ranking of 47 countries according to the links between their degree of international and financial dependencies and the behavior of financial actors (trying to make governance decisions or diversification strategies of international portfolio).

 abstract = {Purpose: This paper presents an algorithm that can elicitate (infer) all or any combination of elimination and choice expressing reality (ELECTRE) Tri-B parameters. For example, a decision maker can maintain the values for indifference, preference and veto thresholds, and the study’s algorithm can find the criteria weights, reference profiles and the lambda cutting level. The study’s approach is inspired by a machine learning ensemble technique, the random forest, and for that, the authors named the study’s approach as ELECTRE tree algorithm. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors generate a set of ELECTRE Tri-B models, where each model solves a random sample of criteria and alternates. Each sample is made with replacement, having at least two criteria and between 10% and 25% of alternates. Each model has its parameters optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) that can use an ordered cluster or an assignment example as a reference to the optimization. Finally, after the optimization phase, two procedures can be performed; the first one will merge all models, finding in this way the elicitated parameters and in the second procedure, each alternate is classified (voted) by each separated model, and the majority vote decides the final class. Findings: The authors have noted that concerning the voting procedure, nonlinear decision boundaries are generated and they can be suitable in analyzing problems of the same nature. In contrast, the merged model generates linear decision boundaries. Originality/value: The elicitation of ELECTRE Tri-B parameters is made by an ensemble technique that is composed of a set of multicriteria models that are engaged in generating robust solutions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {Sewer networks represent an important asset that requires good management according to a long-term integrated policy, which should take into account the state of sewer pipes, their environment, and budgeting constraints. In this scope, a good knowledge of the asset stock ensured by an inventory and data gathering is necessary. The asset considered in this article is the sewer pipes, with a diameter of less than 1200 mm. The state of the sewers is assessed according to closed circuit television (CCTV) inspections obtained by special cameras. The inspections allow us to describe the state of pipes according to observed defects, but do not give a tool for decision aiding for rehabilitation or renewal. In order to exploit available data for help in decision-making, we propose to use the methodology defined in the French project for rehabilitation of sewer networks RERAU (2000-2004) that suggests defining a set of dysfunction indicators according to observed defects following CCTV inspections. We use the defined dysfunctions as decision criteria with the help of the multicriteria approach Electre-tri for implementing the sorting procedure of sewers into specific categories according to their state of deterioration. Our study was achieved on a sample of sewer pipes in Alsace, France. The current paper details the approach for sorting the sewers and defining guidelines for the categorization of sewers according to their level of deterioration.},

 abstract = {Based on the ranking methodology of PROMETHEE, a new sorting method (Flow Sort) is proposed for assigning actions to completely ordered categories defined either by limiting profiles or by central profiles. The Fscr;low Sort assignment rules are based on the relative position of an action with respect to the reference profiles, in terms of the incoming, leaving, and/or net flows. For a better understanding of the issues involved, a graphical representation is given. An explicit relationship between the assignments obtained when working either with limiting or central profiles is formalized. Finally, an empirical comparison with Electre-Tri is made to compare the resulting assignments. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2007.},

The proposal is based on a trichotomous outranking multicriteria method, called ELECTRE TRI (Mousseau et al., 2000). An application of the proposal has beenmade, catching the perceptions from students and professors of a Brazilian course of a Professional Master in Production Engineering, also from chiefs these students and coordinators of courses of Professional Masters of a similar range. The set of criteria was based on literature review and refined by opinions from specialists. The participants of the research were asked about their perceptions on importance degree of criteria and level of influence of the course upon the alumni’ skills, from each criterion considered in the survey. The results obtained from each group were compared. Additionally a sensibility analysis was carried on the results. © 2015 Brazilian Operations Research Society.},

 abstract = {Accidents involve critical consequences that require an appropriate and efficient form of risk management. A multidimensional risk analysis allows a broader view. MCDM/A approaches enable more consistent decision-making, taking into account the DM’s rationality (compensatory or non-compensatory), DM’s behavior regarding risk (prone, neutral or averse) and the uncertainties inherent in the risk context. This chapter presents numerical applications illustrating the use of multicriteria models in two different contexts: a natural gas pipeline and an underground electricity distribution system. Two different MCDM/A approaches are considered: MAUT (Multiattribute Utility Theory) and the ELECTRE TRI outranking method. In the numerical applications, MCDM/A approach steps for building decision models are presented: identifying hazard scenarios, estimating the set of payoffs, eliciting the MAU function (Multi-attribute Utility function), computing the probability function of consequences and estimating multidimensional risk. Loss functions are introduced in the models to calculate the probability distribution functions over the multiple criteria such as impact on humans, and environmental and financial losses. Therefore, Decision Theory concepts are applied to estimate risk in industrial plants and modes of transportation. Finally, other decision problems related to multidimensional risk analysis, using MCDM/A, are considered in different contexts, such as: power electricity systems, natural hazards, risk analysis on counter-terrorism, nuclear power plant. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

 abstract = {This chapter presents multicriteria (MCDM/A) models to classify and assign maintenance priorities in order to allow maintenance planning to be more effective. From traditional maintenance planning techniques such as RCM (Reliability Centered Maintenance), TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) and others, a common aspect of these techniques is the definition of maintenance priorities, based on a criticality classification for RCM, for example. As maintenance planning has to satisfy multiple objectives, such as availability, maintainability, detectability, safety and reliability besides cost, the maintenance manager is a decision maker (DM) who has to establish tradeoff amongst multiple criteria. This chapter presents an MCDM/A model integrated with the RCM structure using Utility Theory principles to include states of nature and the DM’s behavior to risk (prone, neutral and averse) in a decision model based on Multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT). To illustrate situations when a DM has a non-compensatory rationality, and requires an outranking method, a decision model based on ELECTRE TRI is applied. In addition, TPM aspects are discussed in order to emphasize potential MCDM/A problems that may be approached. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

 abstract = {In relation to the economic crisis, the airports were pressed from their national civil aviation authorities and from the market to lower their costs and improve their capability in organizing the supply of public facilities. Some airports reacted to this situation improving their efficiency in invoicing and collecting user charges. An enterprise that supplies different services to the Italian Aviation Authority and to several Italian companies who are airport concessionaires decided to analyse the Italian airport revenues from off-flight services, in order to compare their different results and help them improve their product offerings and identify new products' value drivers. To meet this requirement, an outranking method, ELECTRE Tri, was used to evaluate the marginal and overall activation of each Italian airport in reacting to the crisis and making profit by organizing public facilities and services that are different from the classic air navigation services on the ground. The choice of the method and the adopted procedure were motivated by the difficulties in reliable data acquisition, comparison of different and almost incomparable situations and preference elicitation, without the involvement of the actual decision makers and, in relation to a sequence of model versions, different in terms of problem structuring and parameters definition. A collaborative procedure of model structuring and incremental result analysis and several ELECTRE Tri applications, assigning each airport to a specific category, were oriented to the generation of a 'robust' model and a clear result, to read and synthesize all the information elements, understand the situation and acquire a shared vision of the problem, orient the process of information acquisition and support the definition of some improving actions. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {The resolution of a multi-objective optimization problem involves not just a search and computation phase, capable of providing a representative sample of the Pareto-optimal front, but also a decision support process to aid the Decision Maker (DM) to progress in the learning of the trade-offs at stake in different regions of the search space. This is accomplished by integrating in the search process the DM's preferences to guide the search and limit both the cognitive effort, in assessing Pareto-optimal solutions with distinct characteristics, and the computational effort, by reducing the scope of the search according to the preferences expressed by the DM. The introduction of meaningful preference expression parameters used in the ELECTRE TRI method for sorting problems in the framework of an evolutionary algorithm is proposed. Illustrative results in an operational planning problem in electricity networks are reported. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

 abstract = {A new approach for using the preferences elicited from a Decision Maker (DM) into the operational framework of an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is presented. The preference representation is achieved using the parameters and principles of the ELECTRE TRI method devoted to the sorting problem. The outranking relation is used to replace the non-dominance relation in the usual operators in the EA (crossover, mutation and selection operator). The aim of this approach is to focus the search on the region of interest defined by the DM's preferences and consequently restrict the number of solutions in the Pareto-optimal front to be subject to further screening. This aspect is particularly important when dealing with problems that lead to a large number of non-dominated solutions. ©2010 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The incorporation of preferences into Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) presents some relevant advantages, namely to deal with complex real-world problems. It enables focus on the search thus avoiding the computation of irrelevant solutions from the point of view of the practical exploitation of results (thus minimizing the computational effort), and it facilitates the integration of the DM's expertise into the solution search process (thus minimizing the cognitive effort). These issues are particularly important whenever the number of conflicting objective functions and/or the number of non-dominated solutions in the population is large. In EvABOR (Evolutionary Algorithm Based on an Outranking Relation) approaches preferences are elicited from a decision maker (DM) with the aim of guiding the evolutionary process to the regions of the space more in accordance with the DM's preferences. The preferences are captured and made operational by using the technical parameters of the ELECTRE TRI method. This approach is presented and analyzed using some illustrative results of a case study of electrical networks. © 2014, IGI Global.},

The main contributions of this paper are new techniques for the incorporation of preferences in these meta-heuristics and their hybridization. Preferences are included in the construction phase of multi-objective GRASP, in SA, as well as in the selection of solutions that go to the next generation, with the aim to obtain solutions more in accordance with the preferences elicited from a decision maker. The incorporation of preferences is made operational using the principles of the ELECTRE TRI method, which is based on the exploitation of an outranking relation in the framework of the sorting problem. © 2014 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Decision and planning problems are often informed by the preferences of the actors involved. This chapter aims at explaining what ‘elicitation of preferences’ means for different decision support methodologies. Three elicitation approaches are presented: multicriteria decision analysis, conjoint analysis, and problem structuring methods. The potential of these approaches for structuring and supporting energy-related decisions is illustrated through several applications, namely, the assessment of initiatives to promote energy efficiency through soft systems methodology and ELECTRE, the evaluation of policies to foster the development of smart grids using the Delphi method and ELECTRE TRI, and the modelling of consumer preferences for electric vehicles using choice-based conjoint analysis. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

 abstract = {Energy Efficiency (EE) has been identified as one of the most cost-effective means aiming at reducing energy consumption while maintaining an equivalent level of economic activity. Mainstreaming EE financing is considered a key priority to avert climate change. The lack of evidence on the performance, commonly agreed procedures and standards for EE investments, particularly during the first stages of investment generation and pre-selection/pre-evaluation, are the key problems hampering EE investment financing. It is also true that often project developers do not have the expertise or resources to make a convincing financing case for investors. In order to boost EE investments, this paper proposes a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methodology intending to support financing institutions to identify attractive EE project ideas in the early development phase of project initiation and planning. The study implements the ELECTRE TRI method to benchmark EE project ideas in a standardized, investor recognizable credit rating form. A respective web-based tool facilitating the methodology and the screening of EE projects is also developed, supporting financing bodies and EE funds to rapidly detect and aggregate projects that meet the necessary criteria to be financed. © 2020 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The Human Development Index is an important indicator that evaluates well-being from the geometric mean of three dimensions: income, health and education. This indicator is often used to support decisions, but its relevance is intensified when measurements are taken at detailed levels. In this context, this study sets out to calculate the Municipal Human Development Index for 5,507 municipalities in Brazil. As a result, cities were classified into four development levels. Among Brazilian cities, 2.63% were classified as having a very high human development; 25.48% as high; 33.14% as medium; and 38.75% as low. The classification of approximately 54% of the municipalities was changed. The new approach enabled areas to be classified in a way that was more faithful to reality, without considering that half the population lives with a high quality of life. The multicriteria method ELECTRE TRI-C was used to mitigate some criticism of the index. © 2013 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The Human Development Index (HDI) is an indicator that measures individuals’ welfare through three dimensions: health, education and income. Since its conception, the HDI has been a focus of attention for various segments of society such as politicians, professionals in the media, policy makers, academics and ordinary citizens. The index, however, has received several criticisms over the years, the compensatory effect between the dimensions being the main one. In this context, this paper puts forward an alternative approach for calculating the Municipal Human Development Index, thereby mitigating some criticisms of the index and supporting public decision making. For this purpose, the ELECTRE TRI-C multicriteria method was used, in order to attenuate the compensatory effect, to reduce calculation problems and to allow comparison year by year. An application was conducted in the city of Recife, Pernambuco, in order to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach. As a result, a more adequate classification of the regions in four levels of human development was obtained. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

 abstract = {Selection of a retail location is a strategic decision-making problem that involves the long-term commitment of resources. However, very often managers look for several candidate locations that can be incorporated in a business plan. In this article, a case study developed in a large Brazilian company is presented where managers required to identify a set of interesting locations in a context of imprecise and qualitative information. ELECTRE TRI-C is applied, a multi-criteria decision analysis sorting method in which representative reference alternatives are used to model preference ordered categories, a priori. Trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TrFNs) are used as input in ELECTRE TRI-C, which allows: (1) imprecision and uncertainty parameters to be set in a very transparent way; (2) in the case of qualitative criteria, to define a category by providing information about reference alternatives in the form of the membership degree of verbal values, a feature that was not available so far in this method; (3) the outranking indices to be calculated such that the rationale of assignment rules is preserved; (4) the proliferation of fuzzy numbers to evaluate alternatives to be avoided, thus reducing the cognitive effort of the decision maker. TrFNs obtained in a previous analysis are used in the case study, thereby showing the advantages of the approach. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a method for defining the levels of work in progress (WIP) in productive environments managed by constant work in process (CONWIP) policies. The proposed method combines the approaches of Computer Simulation and Electre TRI to support estimation of the adequate level of WIP and is presented in eighteen steps. The paper also presents an application example, performed on a metalworking company. The research method is based on Computer Simulation, supported by quantitative data analysis. The main contribution of the paper is its provision of a structured way to define inventories according to demand. With this method, the authors hope to contribute to the establishment of better capacity plans in production environments.},

 abstract = {Over the last decades, the delivery of water supply services has changed among regions and actors, in order to meet the changing needs. Those services can be balanced based on the relation between the obligations they must fulfill, the quality offered, and the associated price/value for money. Furthermore, due to the water services inherent characteristics, they are prone to poor quality of service (in general terms). Thus, global performance assessments are of paramount relevance under those constraints. In Portugal, the water regulator has developed a system of performance indicators (partial measures of performance) and, therefore, it is not possible to achieve the desired holistic performance evaluation (global measure). To enable such assessment, we propose an application based on the ELECTRE TRI-nC method to define quality of service categories and aggregate performance indicators. To obtain a coherent family of criteria (i.e., exhaustive, cohesive, and non-redundant) we apply an iso-preference logic. The results obtained are presented through a geographical information system allowing for a clearer visualization of the overall performance of water utilities. The method proposed can be considered a suitable decision support system and useful regulatory tool able to provide policy relevant outputs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {The present article demonstrates the implementation of Multicriterion Decision Making “MCDM” analysis for a case study of Flumen Monegros irrigation area in the Huesca province of Spain. The criteria used to rank alternatives consist of “1” economic factors including initial cost of irrigation system, maintenance cost, profitability of crops, extent of European subsidies; “2” environmental factors which comprise water volume, water quality after irrigation, efficiency of the use of water, resistance to floods or droughts; “3” Social factors including employment of rural labour, area non-cultivated. Alternative policies are formulated by mixing factors such as irrigation system, water pricing, water allocation, crop distribution, fertiliser use, subsidies received. Multicriterion Sorting Technique “MCST” ELECTRE-TRI is employed to reduce the large size payoff matrix to predefined categories for further usage of MCDM techniques. Five MCDM techniques, namely, PROMETHEE-2, EXPROM-2, ELECTRE-3, ELECTRE-4, and Compromise Programming “CP” are employed to rank the alternatives. Spearman rank correlation coefficient is employed to assess the correlation coefficient between the ranking patterns obtained by the above MCDM techniques. Additive ranking principle is used for group decision making analysis. Results indicate that five MCDM techniques choose the same alternative strategy as the preferred one.},

 abstract = {Priori ELECTRE TRI is a multi-criteria sorting method which places the existing alternatives in a series of predefined categories. Each category is known by two profiles that delineate the upper and lower limits of the category, and for every criterion, these profiles have a predefined value. In this paper, the ELECTRE TRI method is considered in the state of posteriori, in which, the expert first assigns the existing alternatives to the categories, and after that the value of each profile for each criterion is determined. The aim of this study is finding profiles in which all the other parameters (thresholds and cutting levels) are pre-defined. To determine the value of each criterion for each profile, a new mixed-integer nonlinear programming model (MINLP) is proposed whose objective is to maximize the lowest credibility for every profile relative to the alternatives assigned to the categories. Due to the complexity of the problem, a heuristic method and a particle swarm optimization meta-heuristic are proposed to solve the problem. Some instances of FINRISK.BDF from ELECTRE TRI software are studied to compare and evaluate the proposed methods. According to the computational experiments, the particle swarm optimization algorithm outperforms the heuristic method and can be used to solve large-scale problems effectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Based on the identification of latent need for improvement in the portfolio management process, this study proposes to assess and balance a portfolio of projects with a support tool for multi-criteria decision by the French School, the ELECTRE TRI. Different from some proposals, in this article we discuss the evaluation and portfolio balancing as a sorting problem. Furthermore, in order to make the process viable for any type of companies, we use the IRIS tool that implements the ELECTRE TRI and is extremely user-friendly. ©2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {In the past decade, there has been an increasing interest in green supply chain management, which integrates environmental thinking into supply chain management. Assessing a supplier’s potential for improvement is very important when an organization wants to achieve certain environmental targets concerning their supply base, taking into account the limited resources available. In this paper, incorporating environmental evaluation criteria into a comprehensive supplier segmentation approach called ‘supplier potential matrix’ (SPM), a green supplier segmentation is proposed to segment the suppliers. Two overarching dimensions—supplier’s capabilities and supplier’s willingness—are used to evaluate the supplier’s green potential. The two dimensions are measured by multiple criteria. A sorting method called ELECTRE TRI-rC is used to solve the resulted multi-criteria decision-making problem. In order to make a more meaningful distinction, a simple method is also proposed to assess the suppliers with respect to the carbon footprint of the raw materials they supply. The results of this assessment are combined with the ones of the SPM, resulting in a more useful segmentation. The proposed model is applied to a sample containing the suppliers of a large international company. © 2017 The Author(s)},

In practice, the assignment of each staff member into a specific team or group is held manually and results into a time consuming task which is also not error free. In this work an initial methodological approach for the military staff assignment problem is presented. The approach is the utilization of multicriteria analysis to assign staff into a number of categories according to predefined criteria. The Electre Tri method has been used for the proposed model which is capable of handling decision problems with multiple criteria.

 abstract = {This work proposes a Progressive Assisted Sorting Algorithm (PASA) based on a multicriteria evaluation ELECTRE-type method. The purpose of the PASA is to aid a decision maker to progressively sort a set of alternatives into a set of categories, which we considered are ordered (ordinal sorting), following a consistency principle. We consider the principle that if an alternative outranks (is as good as) a second one, then it must belong to the same category or to a better category. The set of alternatives already sorted by the decision maker will implicitly define the categories, and will constrain the range of categories where other alternatives may be sorted. We show how the same idea may be used in an aggregation/disaggregation approach, considering some parameters of ELECTRE are not fixed a priori, but are constrained only by the examples provided. In this context, we establish a "convex-shape property" stating that the range of possible categories for an alternative is always an interval of categories. A discussion contrasting this approach with ELECTRE TRI is included in the conclusions. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

 abstract = {Urban public transport systems must be economically efficient and additionally environmentally sustainable. Available decision support systems, including multiple criteria decision models, allow identifying which urban public transport vehicles are acceptable and those that should no longer be used in efficient and environmentally friendly cities. Previous research has ranked urban public transport vehicles by applying analytic hierarchy process multi-criteria decision-making models, from economic and non-polluting perspectives. However, until now, the types of vehicles acceptable for fleet renewal have not been identified. This study proposes a consistent combination of the ELECTRE TRI multiple criteria decision sorting method and the DELPHI procedure, the objective of which is to identify which urban public transport vehicles are acceptable, taking into consideration a suggested sustainable threshold, which includes economic and environmental strict requirements. The proposed model is based on 2020 Madrid urban public road transport data, published by Madrid City Council, which were compiled by the authors, and assessed by a panel of 20 experts to identify criteria and factors included in the model. Findings help local administrations to identify which urban public transport vehicles should be progressively replaced by those classified as economically efficient and additionally environmentally sustainable. © 2021 by the authors.

 abstract = {This paper develops an approach for sorting based on randomising the trichotomic decision about classifying an alternative as superior, inferior or indifferent to a certain number of profiles. The alternatives to be classified and the representative profiles are determined by performances under multiple criteria. The alternative is allocated to the category for which the probabilities of being above and below such a category are nearest to one another. A previous development in this stream is ELECTRE TRI-nC. Results of application of the new approach are compared to those obtained in a previous application of ELECTRE TRI-nC. A second analysis explores the new method when applied to a situation in which the evaluations come from a group of people instead of only one evaluator. The robustness of the approach was also tested by comparing classifications from benevolent and exacting rules. The results of application of the different rules are similar.

 abstract = {The choice of process modelling language can affect business process management (BPM) since each modelling language shows different features of a given process and may limit the ways in which a process can be described and analysed. However, choosing the appropriate modelling language for process modelling has become a difficult task because of the availability of a large number modelling languages and also due to the lack of guidelines on evaluating, and comparing languages so as to assist in selecting the most appropriate one. This paper proposes a framework for selecting a modelling language in accordance with the purposes of modelling. This framework is based on the semiotic quality framework (SEQUAL) for evaluating process modelling languages and a multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) approach in order to select the most appropriate language for BPM. This study does not attempt to set out new forms of assessment and evaluation criteria, but does attempt to demonstrate how two existing approaches can be combined so as to solve the problem of selection of modelling language. The framework is described in this paper and then demonstrated by means of an example. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of using SEQUAL and MCDA in an integrated manner are discussed. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

This paper focuses on the enhancement of the transparency of these methodologies, through the application of ELECTRE TRI, which is a well known and structured multi-criteria methodology. A broad set of multiple and conflicting criteria is considered, ranging from population safety and potential environmental impacts to socio-economic criteria. Additionally, a procedure for the facilitation of the inferring process of the parameters of the multi-criteria model is also presented, along with a case study, related to the statutory land-use types of the Greek Town Master Plan. © 2017, Gh.

 abstract = {Since its conception ELECTRE TRI has been widely used to deal with several problems in the problematic of sorting. However, the inherent limitation of this method lies in its working with only one decision-maker. Currently there is an ELECTRE TRI version that can be used with multiple decision-makers, but it lacks the tools to deal with non-cooperative situations. Thus, this paper puts forward a negotiation procedure to be applied when using ELECTRE TRI. The procedure was inspired by the last-diminisher procedure and a version of the Nash Demand Game, Divide-the-Dollar, in order to establish an envy-free Nash Equilibrium and to control greed. The method establishes a negotiation process between decision-makers, in order to define each player’s degree of participation in determining the values of the ELECTRE TRI criteria, weights and parameters. Each parameter is divided into negotiable shares that will be distributed by means of the negotiation procedure, which represents the degree of participation of the decision-maker’s preferences. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of learning a function assigning objects into ordered categories. The objects are described by a vector of attribute values and the assignment function is monotone w.r.t. the attribute values (monotone sorting problem). Our approach is based on a model used in multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), called MR-Sort. This model determines the assigned class on the basis of a majority rule and an artificial object that is a typical lower profile of the category. MR-Sort is a simplified variant of the ELECTRE TRI method. We describe an algorithm designed for learning such a model on the basis of assignment examples. We compare its performance with choquistic regression, a method recently proposed in the preference learning community, and with UTADIS, another MCDA method leaning on an additive value function (utility) model. Our experimentation shows that MR-Sort competes with the other two methods, and leads to a model that is interpretable. © 2018 The Authors.

 abstract = {Nowadays there is a real need to operate and link existing knowledge expressed by experts, in domains in which highly reliable recommendation systems are needed. This is especially true in the medical domain where knowledge sources are heterogeneous, since they are separately formed in different contexts. A major difficulty is to relate these sources together in a way that respects the specic medical recommendation requirements. Using MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making) models can help in this aim. The general problem we address is to assess the suitability of an alternative (or a solution) for a given subject in a specific context. For instance, which antibiotic (alternative) should be prescribed to a patient (subject) who suffers from bacterial infection, taking into account characteristics of the patient such as allergies, renal problems, etc. We use a MCDM sorting method (MR-Sort with Veto, a variant of ELECTRE TRI), to categorize the pairs alternative-solution (e.g. antibiotic-patient) according to their degree of suitability. The contextual knowledge (e.g. side-effects of antibiotics, characteristics of patient), structured in several ontologies, is linked to the assessment model through a semantic model. The approach is applied to the recommendation of antibiotic prescription, in collaboration with the EpiCura Hospital Center. © 2016 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Sidewalks constitute the main guideway for the walking mode of transport and serve as a fundamental infrastructure for personal travel including commuting. This is because practically every motorized trip is preceded or concluded by nonmotorized travel. The assessment of sidewalk performance, in the sense of its suitability for walking, involves consideration of multiple aspects, whose precise treatment requires in turn the use of multicriteria methods to support decisions. This article proposes a multicriteria methodology for this purpose, thus setting the stage for a subsequent agency decision regarding maintenance strategy development. The methodology is based on a set of infrastructure attributes, directly intervenable by these authorities, and uses the ELECTRE TRI method to assign sidewalks under study to performance classes. It is practical to use and can be applied to any city, at any scale. The approach is thoroughly discussed, and demonstrated for a case study comprising several sidewalks in the city of Coimbra, Portugal. The results indicate that a considerable fraction of these sidewalks are in mediocre condition, and the multicriteria classifying methodology readily suggested intervention strategies, effectively aiding in the decision making. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

 abstract = {This research considers decision situations in which a portfolio of individuals is to be selected. Criteria relative to quality of individuals conflict with constraints on the composition of the group. This work applies to student selection problems in which the group criteria conflict with the constraints relative to the student portfolio. In this chapter, we propose an innovative methodology to support such a decision. In the first step, the Electre Tri method sorts students into ordered predefined categories according to how each student individually fulfills the selection requirements; in a second analysis, a mathematical programming formulation combines the results of the first step with the requirements on the student group to select a group of students who are individually good and satisfactory as a group. The methodology identifies a portfolio of students that is a good compromise between group constraints and the Electre Tri student classification. Although this new methodology is applied in the context of student selection, it can be applied widely in other multicriteria portfolio decision contexts. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

 abstract = {Ground deformation phenomena affecting the town of Tuzla (Bosnia Herzegovina), as consequence of underground salt deposits exploitation, have been surveyed since 60 years ago. The growing of cavities beneath the town and successive surface deformations have induced several hazard factors such as ground subsidence, deep and shallow fracturing and intense groundwater table oscillations. Fortunately, this processes had no catastrophic consequences such as sinkholes developing. Previous studies analyzed the historical database of topographic and piezometric data and highlighted a cumulative subsidence rate up to 12 meters over a period spanning from the 1956 to the 2003. Fractures arose as obvious result of ground deformation and caused damages and demolitions to thousands of buildings, with almost 15,000 people evacuated. Nowadays, in order to diminish the deformation processes, a strong reduction in brine withdrawal has been introduced by the local authorities. This caused an uplift of the water table which actually makes the spatial pattern of deformation more complex. In fact, in the most urbanized area, the sinking phenomena are now turning into uplift displacements. The presence of such a hazard required an urban vulnerability assessment able to support local authorities in the forthcoming planning procedure. The vulnerability assessment of urban elements over a wide area, potentially affected by deformation phenomena, has been accomplished by an integration between GIS solutions and a multicriteria approach based on ELECTRE-TRI methodology. The vulnerability procedure is able to define a discrete map where the 50 × 50 m width elementary cells report the most vulnerable parts of the town. In particular, the ELECTRE-TRI methodology is used to combine each vulnerable urban element with the others, expressed as vector data in a geographical dataset. The multicriteria approach is performed outside the GIS environment by the ELECTRE-TRI 2.0 package and requires a preliminary rasterization of the used dataset. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

 abstract = {The civil construction sector has an important place in the country's economic and social development, producing goods of attendance related to the human necessities or to the productive capacity. The management material process has assumed great relevance due to its strategic role on reducing costs and pushing up the construction companies' technological and organizational innovation. The basic question to be considered is the way that material classification can be done using multiple criteria; hence this procedure is not being use in the construction site and may lead into problems such as lack of materials and production interruption. Thus, this work presents a case study, aiming to present a structuralized multicriteria model to the decision process in the civil construction materials management.

 abstract = {Wood-based construction is becoming a real alternative for many types of buildings in France. This growth has entailed an extensive development of various wood types and methods in the construction industry. As a result, the design and conception of a building involve a decision with regards to the type of wood that will be used. Nonetheless, the contracting authority does not always have the tools necessary to support the choice of the best suited option. In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria modelling approach for evaluating the available alternatives using Life Cycle Analysis and Life Cycle Cost. We use a hierarchical model of values to define multi-dimensional criteria. We apply the sorting method ELECTRE-Tri B in order to aggregate the evaluations and classify the alternatives in terms of their desirability in a sustainable development context. We illustrate the workings of our approach on an example. © 2013 Sustainable Construction Materials and Technologies. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {This paper presents an evaluation method of the state of real estate properties as a first step towards the elaboration of action plans for improving the environmental characteristics of a building stock. This multicriteria and multilevel evaluation method takes into account both the decision maker and the building specialists' point of views. One of the main challenges is in the translation of data obtained from tools such as life cycle analysis, thermal simulation or global cost analysis into high level information meaningful to the decision maker. This paper focuses on the transition mechanisms of the evaluations between the two types of actors. The proposed method is based on the comparisons of data with reference values and on multicriteria aggregation using ELECTRE TRI. We illustrate the working of the proposed method on a building stock example. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

 abstract = {ELECTRE TRI is a multiple criteria decision aiding sorting method with a history of successful real-life applications. ELECTRE TRI requires as input several parameters, such as criteria weights, thresholds, category profiles, and lambda cutting level. We propose the SMAA-TRI method for analyzing the stability of ELECTRE TRI analysis and for deriving robust conclusions. SMAA-TRI is based on Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA), and it allows ELECTRE TRI to be used with imprecise, arbitrarily distributed values for weights and the lambda cutting level. The method computes for each alternative action the share of parameter values that have it assigned to different categories. We list some potential military applications. To demonstrate SMAA-TRI, we re-analyze a case study in the field of risk assessment and management. © 2007 Springer.},

 abstract = {Problems encountered in the context of the maintenance management of water supply are evidenced by the lack of decision support models which gives a manager overview of the system. This paper, therefore, develops a model that uses, in its framework, the multicriteria outranking method ELECTRE TRI. The objective is to sort the areas of water flow measurement of a water distribution network, by priority of maintenance, with data collected from an automated system of abnormalities detection. This sorting is designed to support maintenance decisions in terms of the measure more appropriate to be applied per region. To illustrate the proposed model, an application was performed in a city with 100 thousand water connections. With this model it becomes possible to improve the allocation of maintenance measures for regions and mainly to improve the operation of the distribution network. © 2012 Brazilian Operations Research Society.},

 abstract = {Levees are large alignment civil engineering works with a performance that is assessed with great difficulty due to its longitudinal variability. We hereby suggest that a decision-making support procedure should be identified, built and implemented so as to split levee alignments into homogeneous sections and identify them according to their performance level. Our work is focused on defining actions for the purpose of solving the decision-making problem with regard to large alignment works. In order to select a suitable decision-making method, we suggest a formulation and a comparison between two types of multi-criteria methods: the ELECTRE TRI outranking method and a unicriterion method. The relevance of building a unicriterion for the purpose of our study is investigated considering the existing operational interconnections between the levee evaluation criteria. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

 abstract = {The paper focuses on portfolio selection problems which aim at selecting a subset of alternatives considering not only the performance of the alternatives evaluated on multiple criteria, but also the performance of portfolio as a whole, on which balance over alternatives on specific attributes is required by the Decision Makers (DMs). We propose a two-level method to handle such decision situation. First, at the individual level, the alternatives are evaluated by the sorting model Electre Tri which assigns alternatives to predefined ordered categories by comparing alternatives to profiles separating the categories. The DMs' preferences on alternatives are expressed by some assignment examples they can provide, which reduces the DMs' cognitive efforts. Second, at the portfolio level, the DMs' preferences express requirements on the composition of portfolio and are modeled as constraints on category size. The method proceeds through the resolution of a Mixed Integer Program (MIP) and selects a satisfactory portfolio as close as possible to the DMs' preference. The usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated by an example which integrates a sorting model with assignment examples and constraints on the portfolio definition. The method can be used widely in portfolio selection situation where the decision should be made taking into account the performances of individual alternatives and portfolio simultaneously. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

 abstract = {Multiple criteria sorting methods assign alternatives to predefined ordered categories taking multiple criteria into consideration. The Electre Tri method compares alternatives to several profiles separating the categories. Based on such comparisons, each alternative is assigned to the lowest (resp. highest) category for which it is at least as good as the lower profile (resp. is strictly preferred by the higher profile) of the category, and the corresponding assignment rule is called pessimistic (resp. optimistic). We propose algorithms for eliciting the criteria weights and majority threshold in a version of the optimistic Electre Tri rule, which raises additional difficulties w.r.t. the pessimistic rule. We also describe an algorithm that computes robust alternatives assignments from assignment examples. These algorithms proceed by solving mixed integer programs. Several numerical experiments are conducted to test the proposed algorithms on the following issues: learning ability of the algorithm to reproduce the DMs preference, robustness analysis and ability to identify conflicting preference information in case of inconsistencies in the learning set. Experiments show that eliciting the criteria weights in an accurate way requires quite a number of assignment examples. Furthermore, considering more criteria increases the information requirement. The present empirical study allows us to draw some lessons in view of practical applications of Electre Tri using the optimistic rule. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {In this paper we present a real word application of multicriteria decision aiding for the evaluation of high speed trains comfort from passengers’s point of view. Our study is used as a feasibility analysis for the introduction of multicriteria tools in the SNCF. Our approach concerns different steps of a decision aiding procedure. We firstly define the complex notion of comfort and propose to use a hierarchical model for its representation.We then present in more detail the seating comfort by assigning value scales to its components. Our problem being a sorting problem and our data being very heterogeneous, we decide to use the ELECTRE TRI method for the aggregation of the components. The article presents how the decision parameters, such as thresholds, weights and limit profiles, of ELECTRE TRI are selected and conclude with three fictitious assignment examples. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

 abstract = {E-learning environments can store huge amounts of data on the interaction of learners with the content, assessment and discussion. Yet, after the identification of meaningful patterns or learning behaviour in the data, it is necessary to use these patterns to improve learning environments. It is notable that designs to benefit from these patterns have been developed particularly with the use of educational data mining and learning analytics in the recent times. On the other hand, multi-criteria decision-making methods provide opportunities to researchers to discover and use the patterns in the data obtained from learning environments. This study seeks to discover the patterns in the interaction data gathered from e-learning environments. In this context, the research has two main objectives. Firstly, it aims to utilize the ELECTRE TRI method, which is one of the multi-criteria decision-making methods designed to classify the learners based on the interaction data in different units. Secondly, it aims to analyse the relationship between the classification based on the ELECTRE TRI method and the classification in the real life. To that end, two different interaction data sets obtained from learning management systems at different times are used in this study. The first data set consists of the data on 11 criteria and 78 students whereas the second data set consists of the data on 25 criteria and 65 students. Three different categories are identified in the first data set by the ELECTRE TRI method. Based on this finding, the classification in the ELECTRE TRI method is compared to the real-life classification, which shows a medium-level correlation. Two different categories are identified in the second data set. There is a medium-level correlation between these categories and the real-life classification as well. In conclusion, this study presents discussions on the use of multi-criteria decision-making methods to improve e-learning environments. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},
