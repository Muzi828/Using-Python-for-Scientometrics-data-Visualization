AB  - In multiple-criteria decision making/aiding/analysis (MCDM/MCDA) weights of 
      criteria constitute a crucial input for finding an optimal solution 
      (alternative). A large number of methods were proposed for criteria weights 
      derivation including direct ranking, point allocation, pairwise comparisons, 
      entropy method, standard deviation method, and so on. However, the problem of 
      correct criteria weights setting persists, especially when the number of criteria 
      is relatively high. The aim of this paper is to approach the problem of 
      determining criteria weights from a different perspective: we examine what 
      weights' values have to be for a given alternative to be ranked the best. We 
      consider a space of all feasible weights from which a large number of weights in 
      the form of n-tuples is drawn randomly via Monte Carlo method. Then, we use 
      predefined dominance relations for comparison and ranking of alternatives, which 
      are based on the set of generated cases. Further on, we provide the estimates for 
      a sample size so the results could be considered robust enough. At last, but not 
      least, we introduce the concept of central weights and the measure of its 
      robustness (stability) as well as the concept of alternatives' multi-dominance, 
      and show their application to a real-world problem of the selection of the best 
      wind turbine.

AB  - Background. Reviewing drugs to determine coverage or reimbursement level is a 
      complex process that involves significant time and expertise. Review boards 
      gather evidence from the submission provided, input from clinicians and patients, 
      and results of clinical and economic reviews. This information consists of 
      assessments on multiple criteria that often conflict with one another. 
      Multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) includes methods to address complex 
      decision making problems with conflicting objectives and criteria. We propose an 
      MCDA approach that infers a utility model based on reviews of previously 
      submitted drugs. Methods. We use a recent extension of the UTilitiés Additives 
      DIScriminantes approach, UTADIS(GMS). This disaggregation approach deconstructs a 
      portfolio of elements such as a set of drugs that have been reviewed and for 
      which a decision has been made. It derives global and marginal utility functions 
      that are consistent with the preferences exhibited by the review boards in their 
      recommendations. We apply the method to oncology drugs reviewed in Canada between 
      2011 and 2017. We also illustrate how to conduct scenario analyses and predict 
      the coverage decisions for new drugs. Results. Applying the method yields a 
      utility value for each submission along with a set of thresholds that partition 
      the utility values based on the submission outcomes. Scenario analyses illustrate 
      the predictive ability of the method. Conclusion. Preference disaggregation is an 
      indirect way of eliciting an additive global utility value function. It requires 
      less of a cognitive effort from the decision making bodies because it infers 
      preferences from the data rather than relying on direct assessments of model 
      parameters. We illustrate how it can be applied to validate existing decisions 
      and to predict the recommendation of a new drug.

      Piloting the Advance Value Framework.

AB  - Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) has emerged as a methodology for 
      Health Technology Assessment (HTA). However, limited empirical evidence is 
      available on its use by decision-makers; where available, it only comes from 
      single-setting exercises, while cross-country comparative studies are 
      unavailable. This study applies the Advance Value Framework (AVF), an MCDA 
      methodology for HTA based on multi-attribute value theory, through a series of 
      case studies with decision-makers in four countries, to explore its feasibility 
      and compare decision-makers' value preferences and results. The AVF was applied 
      in the evaluation of three drugs for metastatic, castrate resistant, prostate 
      cancer (abiraterone, cabazitaxel and enzalutamide) in the post-chemotherapy 
      indication. Decision conferences were organised in four European countries in 
      collaboration with their HTA or health insurance organisations by involving 
      relevant assessors and experts: Sweden (TLV), Andalusia/Spain (AETSA), Poland 
      (AOTMiT) and Belgium (INAMI-RIZIV). Participants' value preferences, including 
      performance scoring and criteria weighting, were elicited through a facilitated 
      decision-analysis modelling approach using the MACBETH technique. Between 6 and 
      11 criteria were included in each jurisdiction's value model, allocated across 
      four criteria domains; Therapeutic Benefit criteria consistently ranked first in 
      relative importance across all countries. Consistent drug rankings were observed 
      in all settings, with enzalutamide generating the highest overall weighted 
      preference value (WPV) score, followed by abiraterone and cabazitaxel. Dividing 
      drugs' overall WPV scores by their costs produced the lowest "cost per unit of 
      value" for enzalutamide, followed by abiraterone and cabazitaxel. These results 
      come in contrast with the actual country HTA recommendations and pricing 
      decisions. Overall, although some differences in value preferences were observed 
      between countries, drug rankings remained the same. The MCDA methodology employed 
      could act as a decision support tool in HTA, due to the transparency in the 
      construction of value preferences in a collaborative manner.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several innovative drugs liable to lead to changes in healthcare 
      organization are or soon will be available for the management of hemophilia. 
      Analyzing their implementation can shed further light on healthcare 
      decision-making, to anticipate changes and risk of breakdown in the patient's 
      care pathway. METHODS: Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), based on ISPOR 
      recommendations, was used to assess the organizational impact of innovation in 
      hemophilia care management. The MCDA process designed for this specific context 
      involved ten French experts in hemophilia care management (physicians, nurses, 
      pharmacist, physiotherapist and psychologist) in the hemophilia care center of 
      Chambéry, in the Rhône-Alpes Region of France. This pilot study involved seven 
      steps: (i) defining the decision problem; (ii) selecting and structuring 
      criteria; (iii) assessing the relative weight of each criterion with 
      software-assisted simulation based on pairwise comparisons of different 
      organizational change scenarios; (iv) measuring the performance of the selected 
      innovations; (v) scoring alternatives; (vi) calculating aggregate scores; (vii) 
      discussion. The endpoint was to determine the expected overall organizational 
      impact on a 0-100 scale. RESULTS: Seven organizational criteria were selected. 
      "Acceptability for patient/caregiver/association" was the most heavily weighted. 
      Factor VIII by subcutaneous route obtained the highest aggregate score: i.e., low 
      impact on care organization (88.8 out of 100). The innovation with strongest 
      organizational impact was gene therapy (27.3 out of 100). CONCLUSION: This 
      approach provided a useful support for discussion, integrating organizational 
      aspects in the treatment decision-making process, at healthcare team level. The 
      study needs repeating in a few years' time and in other hemophilia centers.

PG  - e0268584

LID - e0268584
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, the potential of multi-criteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA) in the health field has been discussed widely. However, most MCDA 
      methodologies have given little attention to the aggregation of different 
      stakeholder individual perspectives. OBJECTIVE: To illustrate how a 
      paraconsistent theory-based MCDA reusable framework, designed to aid 
      hospital-based Health Technology Assessment (HTA), could be used to aggregate 
      individual expert perspectives when valuing cancer treatments. METHODS: An MCDA 
      methodological process was adopted based on paraconsistent theory and following 
      ISPOR recommended steps in conducting an MCDA study. A proof-of-concept exercise 
      focusing on identifying and assessing the global value of first-line treatments 
      for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) was conducted to foster the development 
      of the MCDA framework. RESULTS: On consultation with hospital-based HTA committee 
      members, 11 perspectives were considered in an expert panel: medical oncology, 
      oncologic surgery, radiotherapy, palliative care, pharmacist, health economist, 
      epidemiologist, public health expert, health media expert, pharmaceutical 
      industry, and patient advocate. The highest weights were assigned to the criteria 
      "overall survival" (mean 0.22), "burden of disease" (mean 0.21) and "adverse 
      events" (mean 0.20), and the lowest weights were given to "progression-free 
      survival" and "cost of treatment" (mean 0.18 for both). FOLFIRI and mFlox scored 
      the highest global value score of 0.75, followed by mFOLFOX6 with a global value 
      score of 0.71. mIFL was ranked last with a global value score of 0.62. The 
      paraconsistent analysis (para-analysis) of 6 first-line treatments for mCRC 
      indicated that FOLFIRI and mFlox were the appropriate options for reimbursement 
      in the context of this study. CONCLUSION: The Paraconsistent Value Framework is 
      proposed as a step beyond the current MCDA practices, in order to improve means 
      of dealing with individual expert perspectives in hospital-based HTA of cancer 
      treatments.

AB  - This study proposes a set of key decision-making features of the contaminated 
      site remediation process to assist in selecting the most appropriate decision 
      support method(s). Using a case study consistent with the requirements of the 
      U.S. regulation for contaminated sites management, this article shows that 
      suitable Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis methods can be selected based on a 
      dynamic and evolving problem structuring. The selected methods belong to the 
      family of PROMETHEE methods and can provide ranking recommendations of the 
      considered alternatives using variable structures of the criteria, evaluation of 
      the alternatives and exploitation of the preference model. It was found that in 
      order to support a quick and up-to-date application of powerful decision support 
      techniques in the process of remediation of contaminated sites, decision analysts 
      and stakeholders should interact and co-develop the process. This research also 
      displays how such interactions can guarantee a transparent and traceable decision 
      recommendation so that stakeholders can better understand why some alternatives 
      perform comprehensively better than others when a multitude of inputs is used in 
      the decision-making process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current situation of critical progression in resistance to more 
      effective antibiotics has forced the reuse of old highly toxic antibiotics and, 
      for several reasons, the extension of the indications of combined antibiotic 
      therapy as alternative options to broad spectrum empirical mono-therapy. A key 
      aspect for selecting an appropriate and adequate antimicrobial therapy is that 
      prescription must be based on local epidemiology and knowledge since many 
      aspects, such as prevalence of microorganisms and effectiveness of 
      antimicrobials, change from hospitals, or even areas and services within a single 
      hospital. Therefore, the selection of combinations of antibiotics requires the 
      application of a methodology that provides objectivity, completeness and 
      reproducibility to the analysis of the detailed microbiological, epidemiological, 
      pharmacological information on which to base a rational and reasoned choice. 
      METHODS: We proposed a methodology for decision making that uses a multiple 
      criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to support the clinician in the selection of an 
      efficient combined empiric therapy. The MCDA includes a multi-objective 
      constrained optimization model whose criteria are the maximum efficacy of 
      therapy, maximum activity, the minimum activity overlapping, the minimum use of 
      restricted antibiotics, the minimum toxicity of antibiotics and the activity 
      against the most prevalent and virulent bacteria. The decision process can be 
      defined in 4 steps: (1) selection of clinical situation of interest, (2) 
      definition of local optimization criteria, (3) definition of constraints for 
      reducing combinations, (4) manual sorting of solutions according to patient's 
      clinical conditions, and (5) selection of a combination. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS: 
      In order to show the application of the methodology to a clinical case, we 
      carried out experiments with antibiotic susceptibility tests in blood samples 
      taken during a five years period at a university hospital. The validation of the 
      results consists of a manual review of the combinations and experiments carried 
      out by an expert physician that has explained the most relevant solutions 
      proposed according to current clinical knowledge and their use. CONCLUSION: We 
      show that with the decision process proposed, the physician is able to select the 
      best combined therapy according to different criteria such as maximum efficacy, 
      activity and minimum toxicity. A method for the recommendation of combined 
      antibiotic therapy developed on the basis of a multi-objective optimization model 
      may assist the physicians in the search for alternatives to the use of 
      broad-spectrum antibiotics or restricted antibiotics for empirical therapy. The 
      decision proposed can be easily reproduced for any local epidemiology and any 
      different clinical settings.

TI  - Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis-Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction 
      for Detecting Gene-Gene Interactions.
PG  - 416-426
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2018.2790951 [doi]
AB  - Gene-gene interactions (GGIs) are important markers for determining 
      susceptibility to a disease. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a 
      popular algorithm for detecting GGIs and primarily adopts the correct 
      classification rate (CCR) to assess the quality of a GGI. However, CCR 
      measurement alone may not successfully detect certain GGIs because of potential 
      model preferences and disease complexities. In this study, multiple-criteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA) based on MDR was named MCDA-MDR and proposed for 
      detecting GGIs. MCDA facilitates MDR to simultaneously adopt multiple measures 
      within the two-way contingency table of MDR to assess GGIs; the CCR and rule 
      utility measure were employed. Cross-validation consistency was adopted to 
      determine the most favorable GGIs among the Pareto sets. Simulation studies were 
      conducted to compare the detection success rates of the MDR-only-based measure 
      and MCDA-MDR, revealing that MCDA-MDR had superior detection success rates. The 
      Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium dataset was analyzed using MCDA-MDR to 
      detect GGIs associated with coronary artery disease, and MCDA-MDR successfully 
      detected numerous significant GGIs (p < 0.001). MCDA-MDR performance assessment 
      revealed that the applied MCDA successfully enhanced the GGI detection success 
      rate of the MDR-based method compared with MDR alone.

AB  - Health care decisions are complex and involve confronting trade-offs between 
      multiple, often conflicting objectives. Using structured, explicit approaches to 
      decisions involving multiple criteria can improve the quality of decision making. 
      A set of techniques, known under the collective heading, multiple criteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA), are useful for this purpose. In 2014, ISPOR established 
      an Emerging Good Practices Task Force. The task force's first report defined 
      MCDA, provided examples of its use in health care, described the key steps, and 
      provided an overview of the principal methods of MCDA. This second task force 
      report provides emerging good-practice guidance on the implementation of MCDA to 
      support health care decisions. The report includes: a checklist to support the 
      design, implementation and review of an MCDA; guidance to support the 
      implementation of the checklist; the order in which the steps should be 
      implemented; illustrates how to incorporate budget constraints into an MCDA; 
      provides an overview of the skills and resources, including available software, 
      required to implement MCDA; and future research directions.

TI  - Value-based decision-making for orphan drugs with multiple criteria decision 
      analysis: burosumab for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia.
PG  - 1021-1030
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2021.1904861 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Burosumab is an orphan medicinal product (OMP) approved in Europe for 
      the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH). The aim of this study was to 
      assess the value of burosumab versus conventional therapy for the treatment of 
      paediatric XLH, through a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework for 
      health technology assessment (HTA) of OMPs in Portugal. METHODS: The MCDA 
      framework considered 14 criteria related to disease burden, therapeutic value and 
      economic burden. A multidisciplinary panel of national stakeholders participated 
      in a two-phase exercise. In the first phase, relative weights and part-worth 
      utilities for the criteria and their levels were elicited and a reimbursement 
      likelihood function was calibrated through adaptive conjoint analysis. In the 
      second phase, burosumab and conventional therapy were assessed against the 
      criteria, providing a global value score (0-100) and reimbursement likelihood 
      (0-100%) for both. RESULTS: Of the 14 criteria, disease burden, therapeutic value 
      and economic burden criteria represented 27.29%, 57.17% and 15.53% of the total 
      weight in the decision, respectively. All disease burden and some therapeutic 
      value criteria, typically not included in traditional HTA, represented 47.88% of 
      the total weight. Burosumab was unanimously considered superior to conventional 
      therapy, with an average (range) global value score of 84.96 (82.48-86.54) 
      against 48.06 (43.37-57.68), and reimbursement likelihood of 97.50% 
      (96.78%-98.32%) against 43.66% (31.48%-68.73%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MCDA 
      represents a powerful tool in HTA decision-making for OMPs. The results of this 
      MCDA acknowledge burosumab as a disease-modifying drug, deemed superior to 
      conventional therapy for the treatment of paediatric XLH.
