abstract={Software has to be updated frequently to match the customer needs. If software maintainability is not given priority, it affects the software development life cycle and maintenance expenses, which deplete organizational assets. Before releasing software, maintainability must be estimated, as the impact of bugs and errors can affect the cost and reputation of the organization after deployment. Regardless of the programming paradigm, it’s important to assess software maintainability. Many software maintainability prediction models’ compatibilities with new programming paradigms are criticized because their limited applicability over heterogeneous datasets. Due this challenge small and medium-sized organizations may even skip the maintainability assessment, resulting in huge lose to such organizations. Motivated by this fact, we used Genetic Algorithm optimized Random Forest technique (GA) for software maintainability prediction models over heterogeneous datasets. To find optimal model for software maintainability prediction, the Technique for Order preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), a popular multiple-criteria decision-making model, is adopted. From the results, it is concluded that the GA is optimal for predicting maintainability of software developed in various paradigms. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) provides a systematic approach to the evaluation of alternatives based on pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs) under multiple criteria. As human evaluation is not always accurate and precise, each component of a PCM showing relative importance has been expressed by an interval or a fuzzy number. In this paper, we treat a PCM whose components are represented by twofold intervals. The twofold intervals are composed of inner and outer intervals showing the range of surely acceptable values and the complement of the range of surely unacceptable values for relative importance, respectively. One may apply a fuzzy AHP approach by building a trapezoidal fuzzy number from the inner and outer intervals. However, this approach does not always fit the given information. Because the twofold interval information ambiguously specifies the range of acceptable values for the relative importance. Then we appropriately translate this information into a set of intervals including the inner interval and included in the outer interval, assuming that the decision-maker evaluates the priority weights implicitly as intervals. We investigate the decision analysis based on the twofold interval PCM. Three conflict resolution methods are proposed for treating the inconsistency in the twofold interval PCM. Parametric methods for visualizing possible alternative orderings are proposed. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the differences between the proposed approach and the previous approaches. © 2022 The Author(s).},

abstract={The concept of “smart city” is acknowledged by researchers and practitioners as a promising solution to address the challenges of urbanization and promote urban sustainability. Therefore, the assessment of smart cities has become a significant area of research. The current paper defines an evaluation framework by adopting 52 indicators classified under six smart pillars. Specifically, the PROMETHEE II method is used to rank 17 cities worldwide, with Singapore and Copenhagen achieving the highest performances. The sensitivity analysis for the two main parameters of the PROMETHEE II method validates the robustness of the results. In addition, the presented results (PROMETHEE II rankings) are compared to other well-known smart city evaluation frameworks in order to assess their validity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={We present a new methodology to lead the selection of Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods. It is implemented in the Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis Methods Selection Software (MCDA-MSS), a decision support system that helps analysts answer a recurring question in decision science: “Which is the most suitable Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis method (or a subset of MCDA methods) that should be used for a given Decision-Making Problem (DMP)?”. The MCDA-MSS provides guidance to lead decision-making processes and choose among an extensive collection (>200) of MCDA methods. These are assessed according to an original comprehensive set of problem characteristics. The accounted features concern problem formulation, preference elicitation and types of preference information, desired features of a preference model, and construction of the decision recommendation. The applicability of the MCDA-MSS has been tested on several case studies. The MCDA-MSS includes the capabilities of (i) covering from very simple to very complex DMPs, (ii) offering recommendations for DMPs that do not match any method from the collection, (iii) helping analysts prioritize efforts for reducing gaps in the description of the DMPs, and (iv) unveiling methodological mistakes that occur in the selection of the methods. A community-wide initiative involving experts in MCDA methodology, analysts using these methods, and decision-makers receiving decision recommendations will contribute to the expansion of the MCDA-MSS. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={In multiple-criteria decision making/aiding/analysis (MCDM/MCDA) weights of criteria constitute a crucial input for finding an optimal solution (alternative). A large number of methods were proposed for criteria weights derivation including direct ranking, point allocation, pairwise comparisons, entropy method, standard deviation method, and so on. However, the problem of correct criteria weights setting persists, especially when the number of criteria is relatively high. The aim of this paper is to approach the problem of determining criteria weights from a different perspective: we examine what weights’ values have to be for a given alternative to be ranked the best. We consider a space of all feasible weights from which a large number of weights in the form of n−tuples is drawn randomly via Monte Carlo method. Then, we use predefined dominance relations for comparison and ranking of alternatives, which are based on the set of generated cases. Further on, we provide the estimates for a sample size so the results could be considered robust enough. At last, but not least, we introduce the concept of central weights and the measure of its robustness (stability) as well as the concept of alternatives’ multi-dominance, and show their application to a real-world problem of the selection of the best wind turbine. © 2022 Mazurek, Strzałka.

Analyzing their implementation can shed further light on healthcare decision-making, to anticipate changes and risk of breakdown in the patient's care pathway. Methods Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), based on ISPOR recommendations, was used to assess the organizational impact of innovation in hemophilia care management. The MCDA process designed for this specific context involved ten French experts in hemophilia care management (physicians, nurses, pharmacist, physiotherapist and psychologist) in the hemophilia care center of Chambéry, in the Rhône-Alpes Region of France. This pilot study involved seven steps: (i) defining the decision problem; (ii) selecting and structuring criteria; (iii) assessing the relative weight of each criterion with software-assisted simulation based on pairwise comparisons of different organizational change scenarios; (iv) measuring the performance of the selected innovations; (v) scoring alternatives; (vi) calculating aggregate scores; (vii) discussion. The endpoint was to determine the expected overall organizational impact on a 0-100 scale. Results Seven organizational criteria were selected. "Acceptability for patient/caregiver/association"was the most heavily weighted. Factor VIII by subcutaneous route obtained the highest aggregate score: i.e., low impact on care organization (88.8 out of 100). The innovation with strongest organizational impact was gene therapy (27.3 out of 100). Conclusion This approach provided a useful support for discussion, integrating organizational aspects in the treatment decision-making process, at healthcare team level. The study needs repeating in a few years' time and in other hemophilia centers. © 2022 Beny et al.

abstract={In rural areas, the fostering of new development paths requires a strategic planning process characterised by several kinds of uncertainties. The existence of multiple decision makers increases the complexity of the analysis, and it is difficult to identify a solution that is acceptable to the different stakeholders. This condition requires identifying appropriate methods to involve stakeholders and to reflect their different priorities. The objective of this paper is to test the suitability of an innovative methodological framework that integrates backcasting and multiple criteria decision-making tools. Backcasting would enable planners to acquire relevant knowledge of local stakeholders, while multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods would allow prioritising the alternatives. The results of the experiment offer technical advice to outline the development strategy of a Georgian Local Action Group. After a strategic analysis of the area, the Best Worst Method and the Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution (MARCOS) were used to prioritise the desired futures for the development of the territory and to rank the main obstacles and opportunities, while strategic actions were identified through a backcasting approach. The resulting strategy seems to reflect the vision of most of the participants and is proven to be an effective and approachable method for rural strategic planning. Nevertheless, the main strength of the approach lies in its transversality and in its applicability to face complex issues whenever different actors with different interests come into play. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background. Patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia who are facing a lower-limb amputation often require a transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) or a transtibial amputation (TTA). A TMA preserves more of the patient’s limb and may provide better mobility but has a lower probability of primary wound healing relative to a TTA and may result in additional amputation surgeries. Understanding the differences in how patients and providers prioritize key outcomes may enhance the amputation decisional process. Purpose. To develop and pilot test a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool to elicit patient values around amputation-level selection and compare those with provider perceptions of patient values. Methods. We conducted literature reviews to identify and measure the performance of criteria important to patients. Because the quantitative literature was sparse, we developed a Sheffield elicitation framework exercise to elicit criteria performance from subject matter experts. We piloted our MCDA among patients and providers to understand tool acceptability and preliminarily assess differences in patient and provider priorities. Results. Five criteria of importance were identified: ability to walk, healing after amputation surgery, rehabilitation intensity, limb length, and prosthetic/orthotic device ease. Patients and providers successfully completed the MCDA and identified challenges in doing so. We propose potential solutions to these challenges. The results of the pilot test suggest differences in patient and provider outcome priorities. Limitations. The pilot test study enrolled a small sample of providers and patients. Conclusions. We successfully implemented the pilot study to patients and providers, received helpful feedback, and identified solutions to improve the tool. Implications. Once modified, our MCDA tool will be suitable for wider rollout. Patients and providers have successfully completed our MCDA, and patients feel the MCDA may be useful in clinical practice. We encountered several methodologic challenges and identified approaches to ease participant burden. When data are sparse, using the Sheffield elicitation framework is helpful in creating a performance matrix, although patients relied largely on their amputation experiences to complete the exercise. Blinding the alternatives may help patients better understand the process. © The Author(s) 2022.},

funding_text 1={We conducted a 30-min video call interview with each provider who agreed to participate and consented to be in the study. Interviews were recorded with permission from the provider. All interviews were conducted with a single study staff member, who led the interview and took notes. At the end of the interview, the study staff reviewed the recording to ensure all relevant feedback was captured in the notes. Providers completed the MCDA online during the interview while sharing their screen and were encouraged to talk aloud as they completed the exercise. We also asked supplemental interview questions to understand provider perspectives of the suitability of the MCDA in clinical practice. Appendix F contains our supplemental interview questions. For all analyses, we used Stata (StataCorp, 2019, Stata Statistical Software: Release 16, StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA).

abstract={In Pakistan, the fisheries sector is capable of making a significant contribution to the national economy. However, the proper and sustainable development of this sector is essential to its success, and we need to be aware of all the risks that it faces. At present, there is a dearth of comprehensive research that details, compares, and proposes applied measures to mitigate the risks facing the fisheries sector. Thus, this study is the first novel attempt to fill this gap. The data were collected through a survey and analyzed by multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The study postulates that Sindh fisheries are affected by five main risk factors, namely technical, market, ecological, natural, and management. These risk factors are arranged from least to most significant. With regard to the performances of the main risk factors, management risk was ranked as the greatest risk, followed by ecological risk, natural risk, and technical risk. The findings of this study provide a road map for managerial decisions. Furthermore, this study also presents some potential limitations related to the scale of the data and analysis methods. Future studies may therefore use data collected on a large scale and alternative quantitative approaches. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={One of the long-term challenges for policy makers in host countries of migrants is the optimal geographical allocation of the migrant population so as to strengthen integration outcomes and serve the crucial goal of social inclusion. The political debate on the appropriate placement policy of newcomers has continued for years after the large-scale inflows of asylum seekers in Greece. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the dispersal policy of asylum seekers in Greece as implemented under the reception and accommodation scheme. Furthermore, it provides decision makers with an alternative dispersal policy framework driven by the integration outcomes of the already established migrant population in the country. The research encompasses Eurostat NUTS 2 annual data for a choice upon availability of the Zaragoza Integration Indicators and the immigrant population indicator for the thirteen Greek regions. The data cover a ten-year period from 2010 to 2019, and they are analysed with the multiple criteria decision-making method PROMETHEE. In addition to desk research, fieldwork has been conducted to illuminate the results of the model. The paper extends the literature on the governance of migration and contributes to the planning of migrant integration policies in their host countries. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Background In recent years, the potential of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in the health field has been discussed widely. However, most MCDA methodologies have given little attention to the aggregation of different stakeholder individual perspectives. Objective To illustrate how a paraconsistent theory-based MCDA reusable framework, designed to aid hospital-based Health Technology Assessment (HTA), could be used to aggregate individual expert perspectives when valuing cancer treatments. Methods An MCDA methodological process was adopted based on paraconsistent theory and following ISPOR recommended steps in conducting an MCDA study. A proof-of-concept exercise focusing on identifying and assessing the global value of first-line treatments for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) was conducted to foster the development of the MCDA framework. Results On consultation with hospital-based HTA committee members, 11 perspectives were considered in an expert panel: medical oncology, oncologic surgery, radiotherapy, palliative care, pharmacist, health economist, epidemiologist, public health expert, health media expert, pharmaceutical industry, and patient advocate. The highest weights were assigned to the criteria "overall survival"(mean 0.22), "burden of disease"(mean 0.21) and "adverse events"(mean 0.20), and the lowest weights were given to "progression-free survival"and "cost of treatment"(mean 0.18 for both). FOLFIRI and mFlox scored the highest global value score of 0.75, followed by mFOLFOX6 with a global value score of 0.71. mIFL was ranked last with a global value score of 0.62. The paraconsistent analysis (para-analysis) of 6 first-line treatments for mCRC indicated that FOLFIRI and mFlox were the appropriate options for reimbursement in the context of this study. Conclusion The Paraconsistent Value Framework is proposed as a step beyond the current MCDA practices, in order to improve means of dealing with individual expert perspectives in hospital- based HTA of cancer treatments. © 2022 Campolina et al.

abstract={When discussing their future energy mix, many countries are reconsidering the position of the nuclear energy. One of the main arguments against new nuclear plants is the extremely high investment cost. Nevertheless, some countries still perceive nuclear energy as a strategic sector and are willing to invest in it, using different financial strategies. The Czech Republic has initiated the decision-making process for building and financing a new nuclear unit. This article introduces readers to the general issues of nuclear financing in a liberalised European market and, using multiple-criteria decision analysis, identifies the most suitable model for financing the construction of the new unit in the Czech Republic. The three models under consideration are introduced using the examples of three European nuclear power plant projects: Hinkley Point C, Hanhikivi and Paks II. The article compares the three new nuclear power plant projects, each representing a various financial model, with the 2015 National Action Plan for the Development of the Nuclear Energy Sector in the Czech Republic and evaluates them to choose the best model for the new nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic. Thus, it provides a comprehensive overview of the link between theoretical models, their application, and the transferability of the models. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Accounting, life cycle assessment (LCA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) are examples of various research areas that independently develop and apply diverse methodologies to evaluate performance. Though, many methods have in common that the results to be assessed are mainly determined by the inputs and outputs of the activities which are to be evaluated. Based on both production and decision theory, our comprehensive framework integrates and systematically distinguishes specific types of production-based performance assessment. It allows to examine and categorise the existing literature on such approaches. Our review focuses on sources which explicitly apply concepts or methods of multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). We did not find any elaborated methodology that fully integrates MCDA with production theory. At least, a basic approach to multicriteria performance analysis, which generalises the methodology of data envelopment analysis, appears to be well-grounded on production theory. It was already presented in this journal in 2001 and has rarely been noticed in the literature until now. A short overview outlines its recent insights and main findings. A key finding is that a category mistake prevails among well-known methodologies of efficiency measurement like DEA. It may imply invalid empirical results because the inputs and outputs of production processes are confused with resulting impacts destroying or creating values (to be minimised or maximised, respectively). We conclude by defining open problems and by indicating prospective research directions. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={The efficiency of used materials for the construction of pipelines, usually build-up from concrete, is an important factor to ensure specific sustainability goals, such as proper sanitation conditions and prevention of environmental degradation. However, concrete in the sewer environment may suffer from severe deterioration, leading to structural and functional failures. In general, around 40% of pipeline failures are caused due to biogenic acid corrosion. The treatment of applying protective coatings onto the concrete sewer pipes’ inner surface is one of the current strategies for controlling sewer corrosion. This study presents the evaluation of a new class relatively low-cost magnesium hydroxide-based coatings by using Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). The used method (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations - PROMETHEE) classifies the different examined coatings, taking into consideration selected factors that were studied, aiming to evaluate the anti-corrosion ability of used coatings. The parameters were evaluated after the coated concrete specimens had been subjected to three accelerated sulfuric acid spraying tests. The optimal coating, based on the comparison between three studied scenarios, was found to be the coating C5. However, the analysis resulted to different optimal coating for each examined scenario, i.e. coating C6 for the Hand-Held Device (HHD) test, coating C5 for the chamber test 1 (dry) and coating C3 for the chamber test 2 (wet). The results of this study would be helpful for the promotion of relevant Sustainable Development Goals, such as Goal 6 “Clean Water and Sanitation” and Goal 11 “Sustainable Cities and Communities". © 2021},

abstract={This article investigates the recovery of typical wastes (coal slime, sawdust, cardboard and tire pyrolysis residue) as part of high-moisture slurry fuels. Using a laboratory furnace, the ignition and combustion characteristics of fuels as well as NOx and SOx emissions were determined. Using multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods and experimental results, we access the performance of four different slurry fuels in comparison with bituminous coal. The novelty of the study is based on the following features: we consider a unique set of parameters of the fuels (economic, environmental, safety and energy indicators), as well as three countries for their potential use (the USA, India and Russia); three different methods for calculating the efficiency indicator of each fuel were used. Despite rather low energy performance, the summarizing efficiency indicator of waste-based slurries was 53–93% higher than that of coal. The use of cardboard in the composition of a fuel blend showed the best complex result (the increase in the efficiency indicator was 80–93% relative to coal). The least promising additive was the pyrolysis residue of automobile tires. Its addition resulted in a 10–15% decrease in overall efficiency relative to a slurry without additives. The research results are useful for optimizing the component composition of waste-based slurries, technical and economic development of projects for the incineration of various wastes in the form of high-moisture fuel slurries. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) face many difficulties to make investments in effective Information Technology (IT) projects that will increase business performance because they ignore the importance of Information Systems (IS) strategy. This article explores the satisfaction of IT managers using the IS strategic planning process to develop IS. Data was collected from 294 IS managers in Greek SMEs The MUSA method which is a Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach was used to analyze data. As the results of this survey indicate, SMEs cannot improve firm profitability without strategic planning. IT managers should be knowledgeable about IT issues because this can be an obstacle for the organization and will prevent them achieving their planning goals and increasing the value of the business. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={This research aims to find the barriers that affect the implementation of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and rank them using hybrid multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods in the healthcare industry. As companies seek to earn revenue by providing goods or services to customers, they must also consider social responsibility, economics, and the environment as other multiple external factors. One of the most crucial factors is the company's stewardship of the environment, but economic factors must be regarded when keeping the environment clean by balancing the economic situation to make a profit. This study extracts the barriers to implementing SSCM from previous studies, adapts these barriers to the healthcare industry, and ranks them using a hybrid best-worst method (BWM) and combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) method. The result indicates that hospital 7 should rank SSCM higher than the other six healthcare centers evaluated. Moreover, among the barriers, high disposal costs is the most crucial factor when considering implementing SSCM. © 2022 Amir Karbassi Yazdi et al.},

abstract={The paper aims to rank European Union (EU) countries according to the composite index, which uses selected social protection indicators from the relevant database at EU level – Eurostat. The total score of social performance for 2020 was determined using the CRITIC-TOPSIS framework. The study showed that Austria, Luxembourg and Germany, respectively, had the best level of social protection, while Latvia, Romania and Spain were at the bottom, as the countries with the worst values of indicators. The importance of research is reflected in the fact that the social component of sustainable development is still not sufficiently researched, especially when it comes to the application of multi-criteria analysis methods in the empirical analysis of social sustainability. In this regard, depending on the obtained performance values, socio-economic policymakers can redesign existing measures and programs, as well as the amounts of social transfers to certain EU member states. The authors expect that the results of the study will help build higher social standards and well-being in the EU. © 2022, Politechnika Lubelska. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Typical factors considered in industrial practice for process designs are material and energy efficiency, process economics and level of environmental burden caused by the new technology. In our work, we propose addition of process safety analysis into the decision-making. To overcome lack of process data known at early design stage, we have utilized safety index methods that are suitable to evaluate process safety level with minimum process knowledge required. Safety indices incorporated into the developed multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) were Process Route Index and Comprehensive Inherent Safety Index. Material and energy efficiency was assessed through E factor and Specific Energy Consumption. Total Capital Cost and Total Production Cost were utilized to assess process economy. Finally, environmental impact was evaluated by C factor and Eco Indicator 99. The proposed MCDA methodology was tested on a case study of hydrogen production from natural gas and biogas. In total, sixteen different process design alternatives were generated and simulated in Aspen Plus. Utilizing Analytical Hierarchy Procedure (AHP) method, different weights were assigned to every calculated criterion to perform MCDA. After assignment of weights, final evaluation matrix for every process design alternative was generated. For easier interpretation of results, viability maps were constructed. Viability map is a 3D figure combining generated case studies, their score in individual criteria and importance of individual criteria represented by its weight. It was found out that natural gas as a feedstock was preferable if considering material and energy efficiency, process economics or process safety as the most important criterion. However, if environmental impact had the highest importance, biogas-based options were the highest rated options. Process safety factor was decisive in specific combination of other criteria. Hydrogen production from natural gas coupled with carbon capture technology for flue gas was identified as the overall best process route. Copyright © 2022, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.},

abstract={To enhance preparedness for diverse pandemic situations we aim to predict the performance of various pharmaceutical intervention strategies. We gathered domain experts and ran a series of decision conferences where a scenario-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model was interactively defined and implemented. Assuming an influenza pandemic, a micro simulation model was used to estimate societal health impact, a health-economic model was used to estimate economic losses, and expert preferences were elicited to define trade-offs between multiple criteria and synthesize various estimates. Sensitivity analysis to address various forms of uncertainty was also conducted. Nine intervention strategies, including the baseline “no interventions” strategy, were evaluated and ranked under five pandemic scenarios for Sweden's population. We conclude that a scenario-based MCDA approach relying on multiple models for assessment of consequences is instrumental in defining robust interventions and support decision-making at the pre-pandemic and pandemic situations. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={One of the crucial projects underway in Egypt is the lining of watercourses to withstand the outflow of water through their beds and flanks. Various materials have been used in this project, including limestone, sandstone, basalt, and dolomite, along with other building materials. This study focused on the evaluation of rock characteristics to determine their suitability for the construction of a canal lining. All rock characteristics should be classified in terms of technical and economic concerns related to mining rock specifications, such as mechanical and physical properties, and evaluated according to their weights and ratings. As a rule of decision making, management stakeholders select the rock types. The primary purpose of canal linings is to reduce water loss due to seepage. Methodologically, we adopted the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and derived an improved TOPSIS method based on experimental testing. This study attempted the first application of TOPSIS to canal linings and relevant construction materials. The analysis shows that limestone L1 is the best rock-building material for canal linings in Upper Egypt. Limestone L1 has the shortest geometric distance from the positive ideal solution and the longest geometric distance from the negative ideal solution. The results provide decision makers with strategic indicators to select among different rock types based on the total points assigned to all rock specifications. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Quality of life can be expressed as a highly subjective measure of happiness, which is an important part of many financial and non‐financial decisions. The issue of quality of life, namely its quantification, is a current topic, evidenced by a number of literary sources in both foreign and domestic literature. The paper deals with this issue in the conditions of the Slovak Republic and studies the quality of life for each region of Slovakia with respect to the given indicators. In this paper, we deal with the use of the methods of multi‐criteria analysis in evaluating the quality of life in Slovakia. The aim of this paper is to highlight that it is important to monitor the level of quality of life at the regional level and that one of the indicators influencing the quality of life in the region may be its location in relation to neighboring countries. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={In order to create cooling holes in gas turbines, laser and EDM micro-drilling processes are often relied upon due to the difficult-to-cut metals used in these components. Currently, there is no strategy for selecting the best manufacturing process for this application. The operating principles, relevant parameters, operational productivity, quality, and cost of manufacturing using laser and EDM methods differ significantly. The objective of this study is to compare laser trepanning and fast hole EDM-mediated micro-drilling in nickel superalloys (Inc718) using operational productivity, quality, and cost. For each process, a combination of input variables was generated using a central composite design statistical model. Material removal rate, dilation, roughness, and energy consumption were then utilized in a multiple-criteria decision analysis. These values were used to order the combinations of input variables for each of the micro-drilling processes analyzed. The CRITIC method and best-worst method were used to weight the criteria. The ordering methods used were TOPSIS, COPRAS, and PROMETHEE II. The results were aggregated using the average and the Borda method. The trepanning laser machining process delivered the best performance, with optimal settings of 0.4 ms pulse time, a trepanning speed of 70 mm/min, and 0.9 J of energy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This study proposes a set of key decision-making features of the contaminated site remediation process to assist in selecting the most appropriate decision support method(s). Using a case study consistent with the requirements of the U.S. regulation for contaminated sites management, this article shows that suitable Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis methods can be selected based on a dynamic and evolving problem structuring. The selected methods belong to the family of PROMETHEE methods and can provide ranking recommendations of the considered alternatives using variable structures of the criteria, evaluation of the alternatives and exploitation of the preference model. It was found that in order to support a quick and up-to-date application of powerful decision support techniques in the process of remediation of contaminated sites, decision analysts and stakeholders should interact and co-develop the process. This research also displays how such interactions can guarantee a transparent and traceable decision recommendation so that stakeholders can better understand why some alternatives perform comprehensively better than others when a multitude of inputs is used in the decision-making process. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Purpose: Available treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) differ in important aspects. In this sense, each RA treatment option is accompanied by a spectrum of characteristics that collectively constitute its comprehensive “value,” as viewed from the physician's or the patient's perspective. The objective of this study was to perform a multiple criteria decision analysis of different RA treatments from the perspective of physicians and patients and to outline the respective aspects of value for each treatment Methods: A literature review was performed for constructing a set of criteria (N = 8) for the multiple criteria decision analysis. Workshops for the elicitation of preferences occurred separately for physicians and patients. A performance matrix was populated via 2 network meta-analyses plus converged clinical opinion. Criteria were hierarchically classified by application of pairwise comparisons, and criteria weights were attributed by point allocation through convergence of opinions. Performances in both panels were scored by using a 100-point scale. A linear additive value function was used for the calculation of total value estimates. Findings: Both panels provided their consensus. The hierarchical classification of attributes from the physician perspective placed the highest values on the criteria of severe adverse events, clinical efficacy, route of administration, and cost per year for the third-party payer. From the patient perspective, the highest ranking criteria were clinical efficacy, severe adverse events, percentage of patients remaining with the same targeted immune modulator for 1 year (“drug survival”), and cost per year for the third-party payer. Implications: In an era of multiple options and varying preferences, RA treatments must be evaluated by taking into consideration patients’ preferences as well, as to cover the full spectrum of value elements rather than simply clinical outcomes. The results of this analysis show that physicians and patients share similarities but also marked differences in terms of the aspects of treatment that they perceive as more valuable. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Considering the new uncertainty format of Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) sets, this research aims to launch a point operator-based likelihood measure and establish a PF preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE) to manipulate multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tasks within PF environments. Different from the previous extensions of PROMETHEE into PF circumstances, this research presents dual PF point operators to delineate an innovative likelihood measure as a means to ascertainment of preference relationships. As contrasted with the current probability distribution approach, this research takes advantage of the conception of scalar functions as well as the lower approximated estimations and upper approximated estimations via the dual operators to construct a creative point operator-based likelihood measure. This new likelihood measure has novelty value and possesses several desirable properties, such as boundedness, complementarity, and weak transitivity; thus, it can better reveal the possibility of the dominance relations between PF information. More useful concepts of a likelihood-based predominance index and predominance-based preference functions are proposed to facilitate intra-criteria and inter-criteria comparisons in the forms of PF performance ratings and PF characteristics, respectively. Furthermore, their beneficial and desirable properties are also investigated. On the grounds of these new concepts and measures, a likelihood-based PROMETHEE methodology is exploited to address MCDA problems in uncertain circumstances involving Pythagorean fuzziness. By simultaneously employing the positive and negative predominating flows, the likelihood-based PF PROMETHEE I yields a partial ranking of available alternatives and highlights any possible incomparability between alternatives. Based on the net predominating flow, the likelihood-based PROMETHEE II renders complete ranking orders of alternatives and preclude any incomparability among the competing alternatives. The reasonableness and effectuality of the initiated methodology are demonstrated with the assistance of a realistic case about evaluating financing policies for working capital management and a comparative analysis. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Urban public transport systems must be economically efficient and additionally environmentally sustainable. Available decision support systems, including multiple criteria decision models, allow identifying which urban public transport vehicles are acceptable and those that should no longer be used in efficient and environmentally friendly cities. Previous research has ranked urban public transport vehicles by applying analytic hierarchy process multi-criteria decision-making models, from economic and non-polluting perspectives. However, until now, the types of vehicles acceptable for fleet renewal have not been identified. This study proposes a consistent combination of the ELECTRE TRI multiple criteria decision sorting method and the DELPHI procedure, the objective of which is to identify which urban public transport vehicles are acceptable, taking into consideration a suggested sustainable threshold, which includes economic and environmental strict requirements. The proposed model is based on 2020 Madrid urban public road transport data, published by Madrid City Council, which were compiled by the authors, and assessed by a panel of 20 experts to identify criteria and factors included in the model. Findings help local administrations to identify which urban public transport vehicles should be progressively replaced by those classified as economically efficient and additionally environmentally sustainable. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Multicriteria decision analysis evaluates multiple conflicting criteria in decision making, but conflicting criteria are typical in evaluating options. As the existing ordering operations involved in multicriteria decision making cannot easily be implemented with intervals, we assume that scalar representative values with intervals can effectively avoid this issue. To deal with interval-valued criteria, we propose a generalized golden rule representative value approach, which involves the sigmoid function of backpropagation neural networks to tune parameters. Our approach considers the uncertainties and side effects of the interval variables to improve individual scalar representative values. Based on numerical examples, we address the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and we provide a specific application concerning multicriteria decision making with interval criteria satisfaction. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) sets involving Pythagorean membership grades can befittingly manipulate inexact and equivocal information in real-life problems involving multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The linear programming technique for multidimensional analysis of preference (LINMAP) is a prototypical compromising model, and it is widely used to carry on decision-making problems in many down-to-earth applications. In LINMAP, the employment of squares of Euclidean distances is a significant technique that is an effective approach to fit measurements. Taking the advantages of a newly developed Euclidean distance model on the grounds of PF sets, this paper initiates a beneficial concept of squared PF Euclidean distances and studies its valuable and desirable properties. This paper aims to establish a squared Euclidean distance (SED)-based outranking approach and develop a novel PF LINMAP methodology for handling an MCDA problem under PF uncertainty. In the SED-based outranking approach, a novel SED-based dominance index is proposed to reflect an overall balance of a PF evaluative rating between the connection and remotest connection with positive- and negative-ideal ratings, respectively. The properties of the proposed index are also analyzed to exhibit its efficaciousness in determining the dominance relations for intracriterion comparisons. Moreover, this paper derives the comprehensive dominance index to determine the overall dominance relation and defines measurements of rank consistency for goodness of fit and rank inconsistency for poorness of fit. The PF LINMAP model is formulated to seek to ascertain the optimal weight vector that maximizes the total comprehensive dominance index and minimizes the poorness of fit under consideration of the lowest acceptable level and specialized degenerate weighting issues. The practical application concerning bridge-superstructure construction methods is conducted to test the feasibility and practicability of the PF LINMAP model. Over and above that, a generalization of the proposed methodology, along with applications to green supplier selection and railway project investment, is investigated to deal with group decision-making issues. Several comparative studies are implemented to further validate its usefulness and advantages. The application and comparison results display the effectuality and flexibility of the developed PF LINMAP methodology. In the end, the directions for future research of this work are represented in the conclusion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Geographic information systems (GIS) have been considered as good decision support tools to provide the decision maker (DM). However, their spatial data functionalities fail to provide any report about the potentials of the information and cannot make rational choice between conflicting alternatives. Literature review shows that the integration of GIS with multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) makes GIS more robust in decision making process. While MCDA are used to support DMs to deal and solve spatial multi-objective optimisation problems (SMOPs), the use of their methods are suited for eliciting the preferences of small group of stakeholders. Unlike to MCDA, Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEA) perform well on solving SMOPS conflicting objectives since only one iteration of the algorithm gives rise to a set of trade-off solutions. However, only choosing better compromise doesn't completely solve the problem. Recently, a growing interest in combining MCDA and MOEA techniques has been seen. The chapter approaches the idea of integration of GIS, MOEA, and MCDA to solve SMOP. © 2021, IGI Global.},

abstract={This chapter aims at providing concrete reflections about the use of the Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDAs) in urban and territorial decision processes. The reflections provided by this chapter come from a critical analysis of different case studies faced by the Turin research group (Politecnico di Torino, InterUniversity Department DIST) composed by the authors, in some case in collaboration with other academics. Over the last decade in fact, the authors applied a number of MCDA to case studies of different nature in order to provide answers to decision-making problems in urban and territorial planning realms, towards a sustainable development. Specifically, the case studies analysed in this chapter refer to seven contexts: (i) infrastructural transport planning strategies; (ii) location of undesirable facilities; (iii) strategic urban planning; (iv) urban energy retrofitting; (v) real estate investments; (vi) cultural adaptive reuse of abandoned buildings; and (vii) environmental systems. The aforementioned case studies cover different geographical scales of intervention (local, national and transnational) offering here the opportunity to reflect around the use of MCDA as Analytic Network Process (ANP), ANP and Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS), Dominance Based Rough-Sets Approach (DRSA), Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique (MACBETH), Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE), CATegorization by Similarity-Dissimilarity (CAT-SD) and Elimination Et Choix Traduisant La Realité (ELECTRE). The applications presented show that the MCDA can be a useful support to the decision-makers in order to structure the decision process in exam, characterized by a plurality of stakeholders with different interests, powers and goals. In particular, starting from the case studies, the authors highlight the applicability and the decision-making relevance of the different MCDA. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The current challenging environment may cause difficulties in the financial dimension of firms and particularly for small&#x2013;medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which may lead to the lack of administrative, technical, and human capabilities which, in effect, may constrain the capacity to deal with the crisis. In light of technological advances, scholars and practitioners have concluded that the greatest obstacle to the adoption of innovative technologies is the lack of information systems (IS) strategy. IS strategy is a critical dimension of innovation and competitive advantage for SMEs. IS strategy includes multiple conflicting objectives and the use of multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is to support better decision making. SMEs need a guide for effective decision making in the information technology (IT) field and decision-making processes that are based on MCDA methods increase innovation and entrepreneurship. Thus, this article aims to investigate the effect of the use of IS strategic planning on IT executives&#x2019; satisfaction using MCDA. All data are obtained in 294 Greek SMEs from IS executives. The results of this article could enable managers to understand how IS strategy supports the development of innovative technologies that incorporate opportunities to enhance business development and innovation.

abstract={Agriculture is a crucial and strategic sector for developing countries. The agricultural sector in Turkey has been suffering from regression in recent years due to several reasons. In an attempt to reverse this process, we analyze the cultivation possibilities of high profit-margin crops in Turkish lands and develop a ranking among eight alternative crops. To perform a comprehensive analysis encompassing several dimensions, three MCDM methods are utilized; namely fuzzy AHP to determine the weights of evaluation criteria, and TOPSIS and PROMETHEE to develop a ranking among the crop alternatives. The crop alternatives are evaluated against several economic, technical, social and environmental criteria. The results favor the cultivation of soy bean, goji berry and buckwheat, while tamarind appears to be the least favored crop among the considered alternatives. The analysis results are enhanced with a sensitivity analysis. © 2021 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Mine designers often face difficulties in selecting an appropriate mining method; however, such a method should be selected based on ore and rock characteristics. The selection of mining methods can be considered a type of multi-criteria decision making, and this depends on many factors used in the selection process. The general method used in this field is the University of British Columbia (UBC) method, which determines the criteria of the properties that are compared to determine the best and worst of several mining methods. In this paper we used as new technique which defines as Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The criteria considered in the UBC method include general shape, ore thickness, ore plunge, and grade distribution, beside the rock quality designation (RQD), and the rock substance strength (RSS). This paper presents an improved TOPSIS method based on experimental design. Additionally, this paper will introduce a modified version of the UBC method that can be employed based on Excel sheet. The best mining methods is cut and fill stoping and top slicing with the same rank equal 0.72, and the second-best mining method is square set stoping with rank equal 0.65. © Central Mining Institute, Katowice, Poland.},

abstract={Decision making involving multiple alternatives or strategies in respect of a number of conflicting criteria is usually a daunting problem for practitioners from across diverse fields. As a result, academics, particularly decision science researchers have been working so hard over the years to develop appropriate multicriteria decision making methods to aid decision makers in their quest to establish the optimum decisions in their respective fields and problems. In this paper, a technique for decision making in environments characterised by the availability of incompletely ignorant facts, partially conflicting and vague information is proposed. The technique is dependent on paraconsistent logic, Pavelka style fuzzy logic and fuzzy similarity relations. To demonstrate the use of the technique, it is applied to the selection of the best or optimal five energy mix from eight electricity generation sources for Ghana. © 2021 Old City Publishing.

abstract={Objective: Burosumab is an orphan medicinal product (OMP) approved in Europe for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH). The aim of this study was to assess the value of burosumab versus conventional therapy for the treatment of paediatric XLH, through a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework for health technology assessment (HTA) of OMPs in Portugal. Methods: The MCDA framework considered 14 criteria related to disease burden, therapeutic value and economic burden. A multidisciplinary panel of national stakeholders participated in a two-phase exercise. In the first phase, relative weights and part-worth utilities for the criteria and their levels were elicited and a reimbursement likelihood function was calibrated through adaptive conjoint analysis. In the second phase, burosumab and conventional therapy were assessed against the criteria, providing a global value score (0-100) and reimbursement likelihood (0–100%) for both. Results: Of the 14 criteria, disease burden, therapeutic value and economic burden criteria represented 27.29%, 57.17% and 15.53% of the total weight in the decision, respectively. All disease burden and some therapeutic value criteria, typically not included in traditional HTA, represented 47.88% of the total weight. Burosumab was unanimously considered superior to conventional therapy, with an average (range) global value score of 84.96 (82.48–86.54) against 48.06 (43.37–57.68), and reimbursement likelihood of 97.50% (96.78%–98.32%) against 43.66% (31.48%–68.73%), respectively. Conclusions: MCDA represents a powerful tool in HTA decision-making for OMPs. The results of this MCDA acknowledge burosumab as a disease-modifying drug, deemed superior to conventional therapy for the treatment of paediatric XLH. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Objectives. The current health technology assessment used to evaluate respiratory inhalers is associated with limitations that have necessitated the development of an explicit formulary decision-making framework to ensure balance between the accessibility, value, and affordability of medicines. This study aimed to develop a multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework, apply the framework to potential and currently listed respiratory inhalers in the Ministry of Health Medicines Formulary (MOHMF), and analyze the impacts of applying the outputs, from the perspective of listing and delisting medicines in the formulary. Methods. The overall methodology of the framework development adhered to the recommendations of the ISPOR MCDA Emerging Good Practices Task Force. The MCDA framework was developed using Microsoft Excel 2010 and involved all relevant stakeholders. The framework was then applied to 27 medicines, based on data gathered from the highest levels of available published evidence, pharmaceutical companies, and professional opinions. The performance scores were analyzed using the additive model. The end values were then deliberated by an expert committee. Results. A total of eight main criteria and seven subcriteria were determined by the stakeholders. The economic criterion was weighted at 30%. Among the noneconomic criteria, “patient suitability” was weighted the highest. Based on the MCDA outputs, the expert committee recommended one potential medicine (out of three; 33%) be added to the MOHMF and one existing medicine (out of 24; 4%) be removed/delisted from the MOHMF. The other existing medicines remained unchanged. Conclusions. Although this framework was useful for deciding to add new medicines to the formulary, it appears to be less functional and impactful for the removal/delisting existing medicines from the MOHMF. The generalizability of this conclusion to other formulations remains to be confirmed. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Vehicle ad-hoc network (VANET) faces heavy traffic with communication burden to connect with various nodes in the network, uses clustering techniques with neighboring vehicles, and elects a powerful and efficient vehicle as a cluster head. Cluster head vehicle collects all the information and pass them out and transmit outside data to other members in the cluster. However, clustering faces issues such as the inability of choosing feasible and stable clusters for a long time. On the other hand, the nomination of cluster heads fails to adhere to real-world parameters. To address these issues, in this paper, a k-means algorithm and direction vector-based clustering techniques and a cluster head selection method with the utilization of fuzzy-based PROMETHEE multi-criteria decision techniques are proposed. Moreover, mathematical and rational analysis shows that the method is implementable and achievable. Finally, a range of future directions of the study is shown. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The goal of this work is to apply Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis tools, both theoretical and practical, to analyse, support and possibly enhance composite indexes, in particular those related to sustainability assessment. In this context, the Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems Index represents a paradigmatic example and an emerging reference point, thus it is specifically addressed throughout the work. On the theoretical side, the focus is on the property of “independence”, i.e., of evaluating an alternative independently of the others. It is argued that this property can be appealing for an index that is conceived to address, over time, an increasing number of inherently evolving systems. A viable and theoretically grounded approach for devising a version of the index fulfilling independence is proposed. On the practical side, the contribution concerns visual support tools. A well-known projective method is adapted to work with the index, and a new tool with comparable expressive capabilities is proposed. The new representation is more focused on the index, technically simpler, and less sensitive to changes in the input data. The features of the visual tools are illustrated exploiting currently available (partially aggregated) index data. In particular, the new tool is used to illustrate two issues addressed in the scientific literature on the index, namely, the use of scenario analysis as a predictive tool, and the decoupling of energy usage and carbon dioxide emissions. © 2020, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

abstract={The ongoing water deficiencies in arid and semi-arid regions in conjunction with certain nutritional requirements highlight the importance of pinpointing the most optimal locations for cultivating agricultural products with the highest yield. Given the importance of this issue, this study proceeds to prepare soil fertility maps for corn production (Zea Mays L.) in Fars province, Iran. Initially, fuzzy membership functions (FMs) are employed to prepare fuzzy maps for each layer in the geographic information system (GIS), after which feature selection algorithms are deployed to designate the most relevant layers. The layers are then assigned specific weights obtained using a combination of analytic network process (ANP) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methods to prepare soil fertility maps. The input data consist of organic content (OC), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and copper (Cu). Inverse distance weighting (IDW) is utilized to procure interpolation maps for each layer. Thereafter, zoning maps are obtained using FMs. Ultimately, ANP and AHP models are once again deployed to generate the final overlayered fertility maps for corn production. The results show that combining the ANP method with feature selection (OC, K, Fe, and P) results in higher accuracy than solely applying the AHP method. Thus, incorporating feature selection and ANP methods with both inter and intra-group pair-wise comparison would result in more accurate fertility maps for corn production with lower costs and time complexity. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Decision making is a complex task that involves a multitude of perspectives, constraints, and variables. Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a process that has been used for several decades to support decision making. It includes a series of steps that systematically help Decision Maker(s) (DM(s)) and stakeholders in structuring a decision making problem, identifying their preferences, and building a decision recommendation consistent with those preferences. Over the last decades, many studies have demonstrated the conduct of the MCDA process and how to select an MCDA method. Until now, there has not been a review of these studies, nor a proposal of a unified and comprehensive high-level representation of the MCDA process characteristics (i.e., features), which is the goal of this paper. We introduce a review of the research that defines how to conduct the MCDA process, compares MCDA methods, and presents Decision Support Systems (DSSs) to recommend a relevant MCDA method or a subset of methods. We then synthesize this research into a taxonomy of characteristics of the MCDA process, grouped into three main phases, (i) problem formulation, (ii) construction of the decision recommendation, and (iii) qualitative features and technical support. Each of these phases includes a subset of the 10 characteristics that helps the analyst implementing the MCDA process, while also being aware of the implication of these choices at each step. By showing how decision making can be split into manageable and justifiable steps, we reduce the risk of overwhelming the analyst, as well as the DMs/stakeholders during the MCDA process. A questioning strategy is also proposed to demonstrate how to apply the taxonomy to map MCDA methods and select the most relevant one(s) using real case studies. Additionally, we show how the DSSs for MCDA method recommendation can be grouped into three main clusters. This proposal can enhance a traceable and categorizable development of such systems. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={With the development of Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is widely used for visual tasks, such as image or object recognition and classification. Many studies have been conducted to deploy a CNN architecture on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to achieve high speed in academics and industries. However, due to the rapid innovation of the CNN architecture, deploying different CNNs on FPGA faces the challenges of hardware design as well as the FPGA hardware implementation.In our paper, we propose a general-purpose CNN framework targeted for industries to flexibly build their CNNs in the FPGA computing clusters. This framework is based on our proposed mathematical model and provides the rapid prototyping methods of construing various CNN architectures. The CNN architecture constructed by the framework can be deployed on any FPGA available in the cluster according to the requirements of the industrial applications. The usage of the framework requires no hardware expertise for industries, and all evaluations such as timing, resource utilization of the inferred model are provided by a mathematic model. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={This study intends to present an innovative study for ranking the alternatives in multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problems under the interval-valued neutrosophic soft set (IVNSS) environment. In this study, to illustrate the notion of objective and subjective weight, the prospect decision theory (PDT) performs an imperative role in determining decision-making problems. PDT predicts human behaviour in terms of gains and losses and considers the expected utility relation to a reference point rather than complete outcomes. In the analysis of merged criteria weight and the prospect decision-making matrix, the authors get a new dimension level for ranking the array of alternatives. This manuscript provides an improved score function (SF) to convert the interval-valued membership grades of truth, indeterminacy and falsity into a mathematical and computational value. The advantage of this method is that it merges the objective and subjective weight during the proposed method. They propose an algorithm based on the SF to determine MCDA problems with IVNSSs. They illustrate a case study and provide various comparative analyses to show its significance over existing studies. Copyright © 2020 Cognitive Computation and Systems. All rights reserved.},

abstract={To support Group Decision-Making processes when participants are dispersed is a complex task. The biggest challenges are related to communication limitations that impede decision-makers to take advantage of the benefits associated with face-to-face Group Decision-Making processes. Several approaches that intend to aid dispersed groups attaining decisions have been applied to Group Decision Support Systems. However, strategies to support decision-makers in reasoning, understanding the reasons behind the different recommendations, and promoting the decision quality are very limited. In this work, we propose a Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis Framework that intends to overcome those limitations through a set of functionalities that can be used to support decision-makers attaining more informed, consistent, and satisfactory decisions. These functionalities are exposed through a microservice, which is part of a Consensus-Based Group Decision Support System and is used by autonomous software agents to support decision-makers according to their specific needs/interests. We concluded that the proposed framework greatly facilitates the definition of important procedures, allowing decision-makers to take advantage of deciding as a group and to understand the reasons behind the different recommendations and proposals. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper aims to propose novel Chebyshev distance measures for Pythagorean membership grades and establish their based elimination and choice translating reality method (ELECTRE) for addressing multiple criteria decision-making problems under uncertainty of Pythagorean fuzziness. Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) sets have a significant effect on fuzzy modeling for intelligent informatics and decision support because the degrees of membership, non-membership, and indeterminacy, strength of commitment, and direction of commitment featured by PF information are extended for a wider coverage of information span. The theory of PF sets is a powerful tool in dealing with imprecise and ambiguous evaluations for realistic problems and modeling intelligent decision making for complex systems. This paper focuses on both theory and applications of the Chebyshev metric for PF contexts, and special attention is devoted to the theoretical development of Chebyshev distances in connection with Pythagorean membership grades based on various types of representations. To surmount the difficulties confronted by the existing measures, such as low comprehensivity, incomparability in scaling, ignorance of square degrees in metric specification, double weighting, and inappropriate normalization, this paper makes a comprehensive comparison to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed Chebyshev distance measures. To support decision making within complicated PF environments, this paper develops an extended ELECTRE approach based on the Chebyshev distance measure to conduct multiple criteria decision analysis involving PF information for determining partial and complete rankings of candidate alternatives. In particular, this paper constructs novel Chebyshev metric-based preference functions depending on the individual characteristics of the criteria. The developed PF ELECTRE approach leads to using all the information that characterizes a PF set via the concepts of the scalar function and various Chebyshev metric-based comparison indices, such as (net) concordance indices, (net) discordance indices, and the overall precedence index. Practical applications with a comparative analysis in the field of bridge-superstructure construction are conducted to examine the usefulness and advantages of the proposed methodology in the real world. © 2019},

abstract={This paper extends one of the most extensively used multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions (TOPSIS), to adapt to highly complicated uncertain environments based on interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IVPF) sets. In contrast to classical TOPSIS methods, this paper develops a novel concept of Pearson-like IVPF correlation coefficients instead of distance measures to not only construct a useful and effective association measure between two IVPF characteristics but also depict the outranking relationship of IVPF information. Moreover, this paper proposes the (weighted) IVPF correlation-based closeness coefficients to establish a Pearson-like correlation-based TOPSIS model to manage MCDA problems within the IVPF environment. In particular, there is a definite improvement in determining the closeness coefficient required in the TOPSIS procedure. This paper considers anchored judgments with respect to the positive- and negative-ideal IVPF solutions and provides new approach- and avoidance-oriented definitions for the IVPF correlation-based closeness coefficient, which is entirely different from the traditional definition of relative closeness in TOPSIS. Furthermore, this paper proposes a comprehensive IVPF correlation-based closeness index to balance the consequences between ultra-approach orientation and ultra-avoidance orientation and acquire the ultimate compromise solution for decision support and aid. The feasibility and practicability of the developed methodology are illustrated by a practical MCDA problem of rehabilitation treatment for hospitalized patients with acute stroke. The application results, along with experimentations and comparative analyses, demonstrate that the developed methods are rational and effective. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background. Reviewing drugs to determine coverage or reimbursement level is a complex process that involves significant time and expertise. Review boards gather evidence from the submission provided, input from clinicians and patients, and results of clinical and economic reviews. This information consists of assessments on multiple criteria that often conflict with one another. Multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) includes methods to address complex decision making problems with conflicting objectives and criteria. We propose an MCDA approach that infers a utility model based on reviews of previously submitted drugs. Methods. We use a recent extension of the UTilitiés Additives DIScriminantes approach, UTADISGMS. This disaggregation approach deconstructs a portfolio of elements such as a set of drugs that have been reviewed and for which a decision has been made. It derives global and marginal utility functions that are consistent with the preferences exhibited by the review boards in their recommendations. We apply the method to oncology drugs reviewed in Canada between 2011 and 2017. We also illustrate how to conduct scenario analyses and predict the coverage decisions for new drugs. Results. Applying the method yields a utility value for each submission along with a set of thresholds that partition the utility values based on the submission outcomes. Scenario analyses illustrate the predictive ability of the method. Conclusion. Preference disaggregation is an indirect way of eliciting an additive global utility value function. It requires less of a cognitive effort from the decision making bodies because it infers preferences from the data rather than relying on direct assessments of model parameters. We illustrate how it can be applied to validate existing decisions and to predict the recommendation of a new drug. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Background Acute trauma pain is poorly managed in the emergency department (ED). The reasons are partly organizational: ED crowding and rare trauma care pathways contribute to oligoanalgesia. Anticipating the organizational impact of an innovative care procedure might facilitate the decision-making process and help to optimize pain management. Methods We used a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach to consider the organizational impact of methoxyflurane (self-administered) in the ED, introduced alone or supported by a trauma care pathway. A MCDA experiment was designed for this specific context, 8 experts in emergency trauma care pathways (leading physicians and pharmacists working in French urban tertiary hospitals) were recruited. The study involved four steps: (i) Selection of organizational criteria for evaluating the innovation's impact; (ii) assessment of the relative weight of each criterion; (iii) choice of appropriate scenarios for exploring the organizational impact of MEOX under various contexts; and (iv) software-assisted simulation based on pairwise comparisons of the scenarios. The final outcome measure was the expected overall organizational impact of methoxyflurane on a 0-to-100 scale (score >50: positive impact). Results Nine organizational criteria were selected. "Mean length of stay in the ED" was the most weighted. Methoxyflurane alone obtained 59 as a total score, with a putative positive impact for eight criteria, and a neutral effect on one. When a trauma care pathway was introduced concomitantly, the impact of methoxyflurane was greater overall (score: 75) and for each individual criterion. Conclusions Our model highlighted the putative positive organizational impact of methoxyflurane in the ED-particularly when supported by a trauma care pathway-and the relevance of expert consensus in this particular pharmacoeconomic context.

abstract={Constructing spot markets is the core objective of the new round of electricity market reform kicked off in 2015 in China. A balancing market, as a critical part of a spot market, is an institutional arrangement that deals with balancing electricity demand and supply. Imbalance settlement provides a mechanism for settling the inevitable discrepancies between contractual agreements and physical delivery. Large proportions of long-term non-financially contracted electricity and a high share of renewable generation represent specific market situations in China and make balancing market operation and relevant imbalance settlement more difficult. This paper aims to investigate the effect of imbalance settlement design and exploit an effective evaluation method. An investigation model combining the methods of agent-based modelling (ABM) and multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is proposed to search for the optimal design elements for China's imbalance settlement. Different tolerance margins, Programme Time Units (PTUs) and imbalance pricing mechanisms in imbalance settlement design are analysed. The impacts of imbalance settlement on the behaviour of market participants and overall market are revealed. Finally, corresponding policy implications for imbalance settlement in China's balancing market are put forward. The proposed model also offers a tool for evaluating other design elements in a balancing market. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) has emerged as a methodology for Health Technology Assessment (HTA). However, limited empirical evidence is available on its use by decision-makers; where available, it only comes from single-setting exercises, while cross-country comparative studies are unavailable. This study applies the Advance Value Framework (AVF), an MCDA methodology for HTA based on multi-attribute value theory, through a series of case studies with decision-makers in four countries, to explore its feasibility and compare decision-makers' value preferences and results. The AVF was applied in the evaluation of three drugs for metastatic, castrate resistant, prostate cancer (abiraterone, cabazitaxel and enzalutamide) in the post-chemotherapy indication. Decision conferences were organised in four European countries in collaboration with their HTA or health insurance organisations by involving relevant assessors and experts: Sweden (TLV), Andalusia/Spain (AETSA), Poland (AOTMiT) and Belgium (INAMI-RIZIV). Participants' value preferences, including performance scoring and criteria weighting, were elicited through a facilitated decision-analysis modelling approach using the MACBETH technique. Between 6 and 11 criteria were included in each jurisdiction's value model, allocated across four criteria domains; Therapeutic Benefit criteria consistently ranked first in relative importance across all countries. Consistent drug rankings were observed in all settings, with enzalutamide generating the highest overall weighted preference value (WPV) score, followed by abiraterone and cabazitaxel. Dividing drugs' overall WPV scores by their costs produced the lowest “cost per unit of value” for enzalutamide, followed by abiraterone and cabazitaxel. These results come in contrast with the actual country HTA recommendations and pricing decisions. Overall, although some differences in value preferences were observed between countries, drug rankings remained the same. The MCDA methodology employed could act as a decision support tool in HTA, due to the transparency in the construction of value preferences in a collaborative manner. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={A latent heat storage system based on Phase Change Materials (PCMs) is proposed to increase the energy and environmental efficiency by recovering and storing waste heat from combustion gases or other surplus sources at in the energy-intensive industries (EII), currently unused. The final configuration design is specifically adapted to the plant operational requirements, by means of a methodology combining the search of the best conceptual design and a proper selection of core PCMs. To that end, a selection of suitable PCM is carried out by using characterisation techniques and thermal stability testing. Furthermore, relevant key factors are weighted by an in-house Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to define the most promising design options to be implemented in two plants belonging to the EII sector. For the ceramic sector, the design resulted in a shell-and-tube system with 1188 kg of a PCM melting at 885 °C and encapsulated in double concentric tubes, involving a storage capacity of 227 MJ. Similarly, 1606 kg of PCM, whose phase-change temperature is 509 °C, is selected for the steel sector providing a PCM-TES system capable to store 420 MJ. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Indicators are a modern tool for measuring and identifying the quality of goods such as tourism and recreation in a region. Index systems have been established throughout Europe and almost all over the world to present thematic directions through an evaluation of the current situation and analysis of the features that relate to prospects for sustainable development. The purpose of this paper is to present a system of tourism sustainability indicators for Greece which is the only one available that is highly detailed and shows the diversity and the new dimensions for tourism projects and studies. The results of this study highlight the importance of such a system for a country, especially concerning an area with tourist attraction to make it possible for the area to endure in the future, based on institutionalized strategies and goals.

abstract={Health insurance risk analysis is crucial to the development of the insurance industry, allowing insurance companies to anticipate potential losses in health insurance's inverted product life cycle. The health insurance risk evaluation process is, however, carried out in various ways, which limits the application of transparency, fairness, and justice principles in the calculation of risk rewards. By combining cognitive mapping and measuring attractiveness by a categorical-based evaluation technique (i.e., MACBETH, a multiple-criteria decision analysis technique), this study sought to create a nonparametric and distinctive decision support system for individual private health insurance risk analysis. The proposed system facilitates greater transparency in the calculation of health insurance risk rewards. The results of a real-world application of this system were analyzed and discussed in face-to-face group meetings with independent experts who work for two of the largest insurance companies in Portugal, thereby incorporating realism into the proposed evaluation mechanism. The advantages and limitations of this assessment framework are also discussed. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={The last global economic crisis set fiscal consolidation as one of the most relevant goals of economic policy. At the same time, efforts are necessary to increase economic growth rates, particularly by increasing quantity and quality of public investment. However, the lack of fiscal space and other impediments make these goals hard to attain. On the contrary, in many countries data show negative dynamics of quantity and quality of public investment. In terms of energy efficiency investment, trends are positive. However, the pace of investment significantly underperforms the goals set. We argue that one of the major reasons is the lack of financial innovation and project selection methodology. For this reason, projects have still been mainly financed under traditional procurement models. Surprisingly, most countries do not exploit the advantages of alternative models of financing which do not affect public debt level, significantly reduce fiscal deficits and reduce fiscal risks. This article argues that a multi-criteria approach used at the initial stages of project preparation increases the potential for project realisation and the overall quantity and quality. In order to provide empirical evidence, we use information on energy efficiency streetlighting projects and present a case of a traditional versus alternative financing models. Highlights a need for a systematic approach when selecting optimal financing model is a must; a lack of financial innovation is one of the most critical impediments to a higher level of investment in revenue-generating projects common for the energy efficiency sector; alternative models of financing enable public investment increase without harming the fiscal position; a new methodology for selecting the most preferable model is presented; a policy mix should take more comprehensive stance towards complexity of public investment projects. © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={The development of sustainable energy systems is crucial to addressing the environmental, economical, and social pressures of the energy sector. Energy sustainability, as one of the most important factors powering modern economies, is a complex concept related to important technological, environmental, and socio-economic issues. This paper proposes a framework for defining and measuring the sustainability of national energy systems. It is based on several energy sustainability indicators that cover three major dimensions: environment, human system, and energy system. The proposed framework includes data smoothing, normalization and imputation, and application of the PROMETHEE method to evaluate the sustainability performance of 43 European countries. The results show that geographical and income groupings are strongly related to energy sustainability performance. In particular, high-income Scandinavian and Western European countries are highly ranked in terms of energy sustainability. A sensitivity analysis regarding the main parameters of the PROMETHEE method justifies the robustness of rankings, while a comparison with other barometers shows that the presented results are consistent with alternative energy sustainability approaches. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This study proposes a framework for a decision of the fleet composition problem based on a set of qualitative and quantitative criteria, which is a hybrid method for decision-making support that combines MCDA and simulation techniques in a multicriteria scenario for fleet composition. The proposed framework is able, using simulations, to address the complexity of criteria considered in a fleet composition problem in order to increase the preciseness of the decision-making process. From the solutions evaluated, there was a change in the preference of the alternative initially chosen after simulation, which is considered to refine the solution provided by the MCDA method. Considering only the MCDA method, the cost is prioritised and the solution uses exclusively high capacity trucks. Using the simulation and a different weighing process, the service level has a greater importance and a percentage of smaller trucks is admitted as part of the fleet. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={From the rapid development of technology has emerged a novel banking service called internet banking or e-banking. Since E-banking enable customers to communicate with their banks and bank accounts via internet, a wide range of services can be provided to customers. These capabilities turn e-banking as one the crucial factors for competitive success in banking. Therefore, banks are increasingly investing on customer-centric analytical tools in order to investigate the better client buying and channel usage patterns, which can help build and improve customer relationships. However, banks need to seek how to reduce costs while they are trying to improve customer demands and business success. Thus, banks aim to focus on customer-centric factors and at the same time, cost-centric factors to survive in this competitive business world. This paper aims to identify the main e-banking aspects which can influence the customer satisfaction positively and reduce costs. These factors are derived from the literature, and are analyzed via a fuzzy AHP method in order to highlight the crucial criteria of E-banking. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

abstract={Global brown coal resources are estimated to be extracted at around 512 million Mg. They are found in over a dozen countries, including primarily: Australia, China, the Czech Republic, Greece, Germany, Poland, Russia, the United States and Turkey. More than 80% of total brown coal production in the EU takes place in: Germany, Poland, Greece and the Czech Republic. This means that the majority of production still uses conventional fuels, including both hard coal and brown coal. Given the current energy needs in the context of brown coal reserves depletion and the impacts of the current climate and energy policies of the EU, it is very important that all new investments in mining and energy complexes based on brown coal resources must be prepared carefully to ensure high production efficiency and minimize negative environmental impacts. This article attempts to solve a problem involving the choice of the location of the opening cut to expose brown coal deposits. Due to the stratified nature of brown coal deposits and the associated open-cast mining technology used in a continuous mining system with bucket wheel excavators, belt conveyor systems and spre-aders, the location of the opening cut is not completely random and the number of potential solutions is finite. The multifaceted technical, organizational, economic, social and environmental problems require a holistic approach to this research problem. Such an approach should take the different, often opposing, perspectives of the many stakeholders into account. These issues can be solved using mathematical tools designed for multiple-criteria decision support. With the proposed method, a ranking of alternatives can be created, depending on the predefined location of the opening cut. © 2020. The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: The current situation of critical progression in resistance to more effective antibiotics has forced the reuse of old highly toxic antibiotics and, for several reasons, the extension of the indications of combined antibiotic therapy as alternative options to broad spectrum empirical mono-therapy. A key aspect for selecting an appropriate and adequate antimicrobial therapy is that prescription must be based on local epidemiology and knowledge since many aspects, such as prevalence of microorganisms and effectiveness of antimicrobials, change from hospitals, or even areas and services within a single hospital. Therefore, the selection of combinations of antibiotics requires the application of a methodology that provides objectivity, completeness and reproducibility to the analysis of the detailed microbiological, epidemiological, pharmacological information on which to base a rational and reasoned choice. Methods: We proposed a methodology for decision making that uses a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to support the clinician in the selection of an efficient combined empiric therapy. The MCDA includes a multi-objective constrained optimization model whose criteria are the maximum efficacy of therapy, maximum activity, the minimum activity overlapping, the minimum use of restricted antibiotics, the minimum toxicity of antibiotics and the activity against the most prevalent and virulent bacteria. The decision process can be defined in 4 steps: (1) selection of clinical situation of interest, (2) definition of local optimization criteria, (3) definition of constraints for reducing combinations, (4) manual sorting of solutions according to patient's clinical conditions, and (5) selection of a combination. Experiments and results: In order to show the application of the methodology to a clinical case, we carried out experiments with antibiotic susceptibility tests in blood samples taken during a five years period at a university hospital. The validation of the results consists of a manual review of the combinations and experiments carried out by an expert physician that has explained the most relevant solutions proposed according to current clinical knowledge and their use. Conclusion: We show that with the decision process proposed, the physician is able to select the best combined therapy according to different criteria such as maximum efficacy, activity and minimum toxicity. A method for the recommendation of combined antibiotic therapy developed on the basis of a multi-objective optimization model may assist the physicians in the search for alternatives to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics or restricted antibiotics for empirical therapy. The decision proposed can be easily reproduced for any local epidemiology and any different clinical settings. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Health technology assessment (HTA) refers to the systematic evaluation of properties, effects, and/or impacts of health technologies. It is a multidisciplinary process to evaluate the social, economic, organizational and ethical issues of a health intervention or health technology, aiming to inform a policy decision making and to support decisions pertaining to the allocation of resources. In order to empower decision makers to choose more knowingly between the different alternatives, offering a more precise and more structured output as well as contextualized evidence for a specific technology, we developed a standardized methodological approach that integrates Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) with the EuNetHTA Core Model®. This new assessment approach, compared to the Core Model®, supplies a timelier as well as contextualized evidence for a specific technology. It makes it possible to obtain data which are more relevant and easier to interpret, and therefore more useful for decision makers to make investment choices with greater awareness. The application of MCDA to HTA has been mainly devised to address decision-making issues at hospital levels as the numerical values of the technologies’ performances cannot be always easily predictable and/or measurable being affected by the robustness of the evidences, which supports them. To overcome these issues, the proposed method, combines the static MCDA method with a dynamic Montecalo simulation allowing a structured and more precise output, giving the decision makers the possibility to knowledgeably choose between the different alternatives considered, often in a very short time. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={A typical multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problem aims to rank a set of alternatives according to a set of criteria. The problem deals with selection of criteria, determination of criteria weights, normalization of criteria scores and aggregation of normalized criteria scores. The focus of this paper is on the normalization method. Most MCDA methods (e.g., AHP and TOPSIS) use a linear normalization method. Its main drawback is that the 'magnitudes' of the normalized criteria scores of different criteria are different in terms of average. The difference in magnitude actually changes the relative importances of criteria so that the final rankings of alternatives may not appropriately reflect the preference of decision makers. To address this issue, a novel normalization method is proposed. The proposed normalization method uses a Gaussian value function to transform the criteria scores to interval (0, 1). The parameters of the value function are determined so that the average and variance of the normalized criteria scores are equal to pre-specified constants. A real-world dataset is used to illustrate the advantages of the proposed normalization method. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Identifying planning strategies for the transition to a green economy is a formidable challenge. We proposed a novel multiple-criteria decision analysis model which can quantitatively identify the socio-economic and environmental impacts of various government and public policies. We applied the model to four practical scenarios in Canada for determining the optimal final demand that maximizes the country's GDP and employment while minimizing GHG emissions for small, short-term changes. As a result, the model suggested potential ways to simultaneously achieve a GDP growth of 2.5 billion CAD and creation of over 25,000 new jobs, and a saving of 2514 kt CO2. As per the final demand, the electrification of domestic heating and transport should be more promoted. The proposed analysis tool will provide decision-makers with the ability to explore the design and effects of policy reforms, regulatory changes, and targeted public expenditure strategies, thereby overcoming barriers towards a green economy. © 2019, © 2019 The International Input--Output Association.},

abstract={Capturing uncertainty in multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is not a new theme but a largely developing topic which is in close connection with uncertainty theories such as fuzzy set and grey systems theories. Due to growing complexity of construction processes mainly because of implementation of sustainability aspects it would be necessary to take advantage of a novel MCDA methodology as an efficient tool to handle the uncertainty in sustainable construction decision making. In this study, we utilise a novel neutrosophic modified best-worst method (NM-BWM) to deal with the uncertainty in decision making in the context of sustainable construction. The method is an integration of neutrosophic set theory (NST) and the modified best-worst method (M-BWM). The NST can provide insights on efficient uncertainty handling of decision makers (DMs) subjective judgements. The BWM is a MCDA method which utilises two vectors of pairwise comparisons (the best criterion to others and others to the worst criterion) to obtain the weights of evaluation criteria. Merits of the BWM include its capability in effectively remedying the inconsistency derived from pairwise comparisons as well as simplicity and less pairwise comparisons compared to other similar methods like analytic hierarchy process (AHP). We show the applicability of the method in a case study with focus on the implementation of sustainable construction. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The Building Energy Management (BEM) of existing housings is facing influences of Building Information Modeling (BIM). Because of increasing building energy consumption and its responsibility for more environmental issues, BEM needs to be optimized. BIM might be an opportunity for such an optimization. In order to successfully execute the BIM implementation in BEM, a quantitative measurement of BIM influences is needed, while currently in lack. The purpose of this paper is to solve the quantitative measurement problem by a metric system. Using Multiple Criteria Analysis, this metric system aims to measure BIM influences in BEM, especially of existing housings. In real case study of a French social housing manager Pluralis, Key Performance Indicators (KPI) measurement results are obtained in scores and displayed also in chart. The consistency of measurement results and identified real issues confirms the feasibility and credibility of this metric system in measuring BEM and indicating the priority optimization aspects, such as cost and interoperability. Quantitative distinguish between performance and competence is down, which is essential for BIM implementation. © 2019, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Post-acute care (PAC) is an interdisciplinary healthcare service used to assist in returning patients to their community after they receive acute medical services. To establish a fully developed PAC service model, the National Health Insurance Administration in Taiwan attempts to recruit professional medical service institutions (consisting of medical centers and regional and district hospitals) in a trial program for improving the rehabilitation quality of patients with cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs) and to reduce the re-hospitalization rate. The evaluation and selection of adequate medical service institutions are critical in the program for enhancing the effectiveness of hospital-based PAC in acute stroke management. However, because of the complexity of the national health insurance system and the healthcare system in Taiwan, the determination of pilot hospitals is a highly complicated and ambiguous multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problem. Focusing on the requirement of generating a set of pilot hospitals for the PAC program and tackling imprecise and uncertain information associated with a complex medical circumstance, the purpose of this paper is to develop a novel compromising decision-making method based on the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IVPF) set theory and the VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) methodology to address the multiple criteria selection problem of pilot hospitals in assisting the establishment of a hospital-based PAC model. Considering the powerfulness of IVPF sets when handling vagueness and complex uncertainty in practical problems, this paper proposes a useful IVPF VIKOR method that is significantly different from the existing VIKOR methodology. The proposed methodology represents a comprehensive integration of high-order uncertainties within a decision environment into the basic VIKOR structure that is designed to lead to both better description and better applicability of MCDA. This paper presents some novel concepts such as remoteness indices and remoteness-based multiple criteria ranking indices and investigates their desirable properties in detail. With the theoretical support of these new concepts, this paper establishes useful remoteness-based group utility indices, individual regret indices, and compromise indices for the assessment of acceptable advantage and acceptable stability. Unlike the current VIKOR-based ranking process, this paper provides a systematic ranking procedure that is capable of improving the efficiency of determining ultimate compromise solutions. Overall, the present study provides several significant contributions, such as structuring the selection problem for hospital-based PAC, extending the IVPF theory and VIKOR to the medical and healthcare fields, simplifying the manipulation procedure in handling IVPF information, constructing valuable concepts of remoteness-based indices, and developing an effective IVPF VIKOR ranking procedure. A real-world example of selecting pilot hospitals in the PAC program for CVDs is provided to illustrate the application of the proposed method and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness. Furthermore, other valuable MCDA applications with a comparative analysis are conducted to validate the advantages of the proposed method in a variety of fields. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

abstract={Today's ultra-connected world is generating a huge amount of data stored in databases and cloud environment especially in the era of transportation. These databases need to be processed and analyzed to extract useful information and present it as a valid element for transportation managers for further use, such as road safety, shipping delays, and shipping optimization. The potential of data mining algorithms is largely untapped, this paper shows large-scale techniques such as associations rule analysis, multiple criteria analysis, and time series to improve road safety by identifying hot-spots in advance and giving chance to drivers to avoid the dangers. Indeed, we proposed a framework DM-MCDA based on association rules mining as a preliminary task to extract relationships between variables related to a road accident, and then integrate multiple criteria analysis to help decision-makers to make their choice of the most relevant rules. The developed system is flexible and allows intuitive creation and execution of different algorithms for an extensive range of road traffic topics. DM-MCDA can be expanded with new topics on demand, rendering knowledge extraction more robust and provide meaningful information that could help in developing suitable policies for decision-makers. © 2019},

abstract={The paper considers the shortand medium-term planning problems of the regimes of multi-line technical gas pipeline corridors (MLGP) of Russian gas supply system. The fall in gas production due to the depletion of the gas fields leads to a decrease in the load of some operating MLGPs. At the same time, there is a redundancy of production capacities at compressor stations (CS). It becomes possible to use various technological schemes for incorporating CS with lines »pass by» in order to reduce the cost of gas pumping. The solution of the optimization task for the search for MLGP regimes in a one-criterion (minimum of the energy cost) formulation leads to frequent equipment switching. That is unacceptable. Therefore, it is advisable to proceed to multi-criteria statements, formalizing and introducing as criteria the requirements for the stability of technological schemes for switching on equipment, which are usually respected by the dispatch services. The purpose of this article is the development and testing of mathematical models and a computer program to support the adoption of dispatch solutions for managing modes of large MLGPs under conditions of incomplete loading. The solution method is demonstrated by the example of a three-line MLGP. The choice of optimal control is carried out using dynamic programming methods. In order to improve the quality of the choice of control actions, an algorithm is suggested that takes into account the stochastic nature of the loading of the MLGP. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.},

abstract={Ecotourism contains the integration from ecological integrity and economic benefits to environmental and historically sensitive areas. One of the major keys of ecotourism-planning strategies is to ensure the sustainability of unique natural and cultural resources by a balance strategy between protection and use. It causes both the increase of the ecotourism awareness of local people and visitors and the decrease of the environmental problems and visitor pressures on the landscape resources of potential ecotourism areas. For this reason, the study presents the example of Iznik which is an ancient Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman city of Nicaea with its lake, historical walls and gates, churches and early-period mosques, ceramic tiles, and agricultural activities on the southeast of Marmara Region, Turkey. It has been declared to have a different protected area status. However, the number of unsuitable management and uncontrolled economic activities has caused damage to sensitive landscape values. The aim of this research is to define ecotourism criteria for Iznik and it offers ecotourism strategies for the sustainability of sensitive landscape areas. Fieldwork, field observation, interviews and survey study with integrated multiple-criteria decision analysis and strengths-weakness-opportunities-threats (SWOT) analysis conducted with locals, tourists and experts were performed for this purpose. According to the results, among the 4 main and 15 sub-criteria of ecotourism to be in UNESCO Tentative List, the opportunity for ecotourism-planning strategy was found as the highest priority ranking. This research proposes a framework by using a priority-ranking method for the development of ecotourism strategies in the town. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={A novel framework has been developed for delineating groundwater potential zones (GWPZ) using fuzzy datasets and the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) integrated with hydrogeological, geophysical and geospatial data for a hard-rock trap-covered terrain in Maharashtra, India. This approach is based on the consideration of ten factors that influence groundwater potential: aquifer resistivity, aquifer thickness, transverse resistance, electrical anisotropy, drainage density, lineament density, rainfall, slope, geology and land use/land cover. The ranks and weights were obtained by fuzzy and AHP techniques and assigned to these layers and their feature class. The reclassified layers were integrated in a geographical information system environment to delineate the GWPZ of the study basin. The findings reveal that the areas of very high groundwater potential are located in the plateau region and plains of the basin that occupy about 11.5% of the total study area. These results are further validated using the relative operating characteristics technique, wherein area under the curve is 0.83, indicating good accuracy. The study highlights that such an integrated approach is reliable and can be applied in other semi-arid regions of the world to help hydrogeologists manage groundwater resources. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={A lot of different types of accelerating admixtures for concrete are used nowadays. The aim of this paper is to determine efficiency relations between several accelerating admixtures for concrete with usage of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). Tests of cements' initial setting time, consistency and compressive strength of mortars were made. Tests of cements and fresh mortars were conducted in temperature 8°C and 20°C. Compressive strength were tested after 12, 24, 48 hours and 7, 28 days of curing. Specimens for those tests were cured in temperature 8°C in water and 20°C in climatic chamber with relative humidity 60%. Mortars were made of Portland cement (CEM I 52,5R), Portland-slag cement (CEM II/B-S) and two kinds of blast furnace cement (CEM III/A, CEM III/C). Examined admixtures were based on calcium formate, crystal seeds and calcium nitrate. All of them are described as both set and hardening accelerators for concrete. Admixtures were added in maximum dosage allowed by producer. All of admixtures caused decrease of initial setting time and increase of early compressive strength (12-48 hours) with varying degrees. Decrease of 28 days compressive strength was not noted in case of any admixture. In order to determination of efficiency relations the multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was made for every kind of cement separately. Criteria were defined on the basis of conducted tests and were divided accordingly to environmental conditions. Weights of criteria were evaluated with pair analysis method. Values of tests' results were converted with usage of Neuman-Morgenstern method. Result of analysis is sum of criteria evaluations according to their weights. Accelerating admixture based on crystal seeds in proven to be the most efficient one, while the one based on calcium formate is the least efficient of tested admixtures. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={Pythagorean fuzzy sets are powerful techniques for modeling vagueness in practice. The aim of this article is to investigate an effective means to aggregate uncertain information and then employ it into settling multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problems within the Pythagorean fuzzy circumstances. To capture the nature of the reality, some special cases should be comprehensively considered. First, though correlation commonly exist among criteria, a deep insight should also be provided into some realistic situations, in which not all the criteria are interrelated to others. Besides, it is more reasonable to take the importance of the input arguments into consideration. Effected by aforementioned point, this article explores a Pythagorean fuzzy partitioned normalized weighted Bonferroni mean (PFPNWBM) operator with the combination of partitioned Bonferroni mean (BM) and normalized weighted BM operators considering Shapley fuzzy measure. Subsequently, in the context of partially known weight information, models are established to identify the optimal Shapley fuzzy measure. Moreover, integrated the PFPNWBM operator with the optimal Shapley fuzzy measure identification model, a Pythagorean fuzzy MCDM approach is designed. Finally, an illustrative example and detailed analyses are performed to demonstrate its feasibility and reliability. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Towards the last decade, digital education has become a burning issue in the related scientific literature and involves the production of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). ITSs are adaptive educational applications that enrich the tutoring and learning processes with 'intelligence' by divulging the abilities and weaknesses of each student, in order to provide him/her with a personalized learning experience. A crucial factor of adaptive learning systems is testing, and indeed adaptive testing. It is a challenge to create an adaptive test that includes the most suitable exercise/question/activity of a large pool of test items for a particular learner taking into consideration her/ his particular learning characteristics, needs and ability. In this paper, a framework for creating automated adaptive tests using multiple-criteria decision analysis and the weighted sum model is presented. The presented framework takes into consideration multiple students' criteria along with the types of exercises and the desirable learning objective. The aforementioned assessment framework was incorporated in two adaptive e-learning systems and was fully evaluated. The evaluation results are very encouraging. © 2018 IEEE.},

A review of the literature reveals that although a number of studies have been done on these issues, but none of them have explicitly studied the variations in expert's opinion (intra-personal uncertainty) and the variations in the understanding among experts (inter-personal uncertainty) together. To deal with this problem, this literature proposes a new fuzzy FMECA approach based on IT2 fuzzy sets, which has the ability to capture both intra-personal and inter-personal uncertainty. This approach introduces a more accurate representation of the aggregated data by presenting variations among the individual judgements into type-2 fuzzy numbers, allowing suitable weights for each risk factor by decision makers and thereby developing a flexibility for analysis. The proposed method is applied to evaluate the criticality of different failure modes of boiler tubes of a coal-fired thermal power plants. Interval type-2 fuzzy sets with signed distances, a multi criteria decision-making tool, is used to evaluate the criticalities of the different failure modes (alternatives) of the system.

abstract={This paper is an attempt to solve various problems by the two factors of mean and standard deviation (SD) of variables, introducing coefficient of variation (CV) of data as the best option for prioritization, scaling, pairwise comparison and normalization of quantitative and qualitative variables. An algorithm was built based on a coefficient of variation scales triangle (CVST) consisting of natural numbers with coefficients of binomial expansion for each line, followed by new and independent grading and scaling. In view of the existing factors, the theory provides higher generalization and maximum reliability rates in comparison to other methods for multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). On the other hand, in the normalization process of different variables (i.e. de-scalarization), a precise and infinite model was presented based on coefficient of variation scale triangle (multipurpose triangle), in such a way that decision makers could work with the software in a more convenient and precise manner. Therefore, the proposed theories may be considered as a new approach and definition in the valuation and progress of MCDA. © 2019, International Journal of the Analytic Hierarchy Process.},

abstract={This paper aims at developing a novel generalized distance measure of Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) sets and constructing a distance-based compromise approach for multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) within PF environments. The theory of Pythagorean fuzziness provides a representative model of nonstandard fuzzy sets; it is valuable for representing complex vague or imprecise information in many practical applications. The distance measure for Pythagorean membership grades is important because it can effectively quantify the separation between PF information. Based on the essential characteristics of PF sets (membership, non-membership, strength, and direction), this paper proposes several distance measures, namely, new Hamming and Euclidean distances and a generalized distance measure that is based on them for Pythagorean membership grades and for PF sets. Moreover, the useful and desirable properties of the proposed PF distance measures are investigated to evaluate their advantages and form a solid theoretical basis. In addition, to evaluate the performance of the proposed distance measures in practice, this paper establishes a PF-distance-based compromise approach for addressing MCDA problems that involve PF information. The effectiveness and practicability of the developed approach are further evaluated through a case study on bridge-superstructure construction methods. According to the application results and comparative analysis, the proposed PF distance measures are accurate and outperform other methods in handling the inherent uncertainties of evaluation information. Furthermore, the PF-distance-based compromise approach can accommodate the much higher degrees of uncertainty in real-life decision scenarios and effectively determine the priority ranking among candidate alternatives for managing complicated MCDA problems. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Companies often face a challenge when they need to select their projects for execution because the resources are not enough for all of them. For supporting decision, they need to employ some form of selecting the best portfolio to run. There are several proposals in the literature, many allowing an evaluation of efficiency between expected return and risk. However, these proposals indicate a list of efficient portfolios, but not the one best suited for execution. On the other hand, multi-criteria analysis methods allow a more specific indication, but they are difficult to be executed when the number of projects increases. This work seeks to cover this gap by proposing a selection method that combines the return-risk assessment using mean-Gini approach, complemented by the application of the multi-criteria decision method PROMETHEE II. The result is the objective indication of the best project portfolio to be executed by the company. Copyright © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The aim of this article is to develop a novel multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method using a Pearson-like correlation-based Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) compromise approach under complex uncertainty based on PF sets and interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IVPF) sets. Because of the complexity and ambiguity involved in real-life decision-making situations, this article utilizes the theory of Pythagorean fuzziness, which is characterized by flexible degrees of membership, nonmembership, and indeterminacy to describe uncertain information more comprehensively. PF and IVPF sets possess exceptional abilities to accurately reflect the uncertainty, fuzziness, and vagueness inherent in the decision information. However, manipulating PF and IVPF information is a complicated and difficult task for most decision makers. In this regard, this article extends the well-known and widely used concept of correlation coefficients to develop simple and effective compromise models for solving MCDA problems in PF and IVPF contexts. This article conducts an extended analysis of Pearson-like correlation coefficients for PF and IVPF sets separately and introduces new concepts of PF and IVPF correlation coefficients to furnish a solid basis for the proposed methodology. Furthermore, this article develops useful concepts of PF and IVPF correlation-based closeness coefficients to simultaneously measure the relative closeness to the positive-ideal PF/IVPF solutions and the relative remoteness from the negative-ideal PF/IVPF solutions. On the basis of the developed concepts, this article proposes a novel Pearson-like correlation-based PF/IVPF compromise approach to address uncertain MCDA problems involving PF/IVPF information and determine the ultimate priority orders among competing alternatives. Finally, this article provides an illustrative application about a financing decision of working capital management to verify the developed approach and demonstrate its feasibility and practicality. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Gene-gene interactions (GGIs) are important markers for determining susceptibility to a disease. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a popular algorithm for detecting GGIs and primarily adopts the correct classification rate (CCR) to assess the quality of a GGI. However, CCR measurement alone may not successfully detect certain GGIs because of potential model preferences and disease complexities. In this study, multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) based on MDR was named MCDA-MDR and proposed for detecting GGIs. MCDA facilitates MDR to simultaneously adopt multiple measures within the two-way contingency table of MDR to assess GGIs; the CCR and rule utility measure were employed. Cross-validation consistency was adopted to determine the most favorable GGIs among the Pareto sets. Simulation studies were conducted to compare the detection success rates of the MDR-only-based measure and MCDA-MDR, revealing that MCDA-MDR had superior detection success rates. The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium dataset was analyzed using MCDA-MDR to detect GGIs associated with coronary artery disease, and MCDA-MDR successfully detected numerous significant GGIs (p < 0.001). MCDA-MDR performance assessment revealed that the applied MCDA successfully enhanced the GGI detection success rate of the MDR-based method compared with MDR alone. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods have shown advantages in supporting decision-making with problems that confront conflicting objectives. However, current applications to complex environmental problems featuring the dynamic social sphere, particularly problems involving cultural heritage and nature, have yet to substantially reflect this. The dynamic social sphere reflects the demand for scenario forecasting in decision-making support. This knowledge gap has not been addressed sufficiently in MCDA research. A participatory MCDA method is hence proposed as a merger with Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) as the scenario forecasting. The MCDA is then carried out to tackle a complex environmental problem caused by traditional food production in a historic town, Daxi in Taiwan. The result reveals a remarkable willingness to support this issue of a historically significant industry causing detriment to environment (with WTP estimate of 128,700,000 USD from the public) and suggests a plan that applies multiple policy instruments rather than following a potentially adverse polluter-pays principle. This manifests the authors' argument that recognition of heritage significance has dramatically affected selection of policy instruments and provides a critical recommendation to the local government which has struggled to find solutions. The proposed MCDA also highlights its participatory aspect for addressing issues involving cultural heritage, supported by several key steps, in particular the intervention-impact value tree building, the scenario forecasting and the sensitivity analysis. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Cloud computing is a paradigm that provides services through the Internet. The paradigm has been influenced by previously available technologies (for example cluster, peer-to-peer, and grid computing) and has now been adopted by almost all large organizations. Companies such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook have made significant investments in cloud computing, and now provide services with high levels of dependability. The efficient and accurate assessment of cloud-based infrastructure is fundamental in guaranteeing both business continuity and uninterrupted public services, as much as is possible. This paper presents an approach for selecting cloud computing infrastructures, in terms of dependability and cost that best suits both company and customer needs. We use stochastic models to calculate dependability-related metrics for different cloud infrastructures. We then use a Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method to rank the best cloud infrastructures, taking customer service constraints such as reliability, downtime, and cost into consideration. A case study demonstrates the practicability and usefulness of the proposed approach. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Economic development of unconventional reservoirs requires a combination of different techniques such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. To obtain valuable information about the effectiveness of a hydraulic fracturing operation, it is a common practice to use borehole microseismic monitoring by deploying arrays of geophones in wells nearby. Microseismic monitoring provides important data about fracture parameters including: half-length, geometry, orientation and complexity of the fracture network. Based on this information, stimulation programs can be improved to increase production volumes. However, inaccurate microseismic acquisition design can result in poor quality raw microseismic data that undermines the success of this important operation. In this study, we developed a comprehensive workflow using Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to optimize microseismic acquisition design in order to improve borehole microseismic data quality. The influence of multiple parameters, such as average distance to microseismic events, receiver and event aperture, and wave-field complexity, is considered. A computer code is developed to resolve the conflicting parameters to achieve the best possible data quality. The program output is used recommend an optimum depth and location for deploying the borehole geophone array(s). The algorithm is then applied to a case study that utilizes synthetic microseismic data and real well trajectories from several vertical and horizontal wells in Williston Basin, North Dakota. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper aims to present a novel outranking approach of the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEEs) based on Pythagorean fuzzy sets for multiple criteria decision analysis. The proposed method utilizes a novel Pythagorean fuzzy precedence index, which is based on the difference of scalar functions under anchored judgments with respect to the superiority/inferiority Pythagorean fuzzy numbers. To appropriately describe the hesitation between indifference and preference in the Pythagorean fuzzy context, this paper introduces useful precedence-based preference functions to establish the precedence relations based on pairwise comparisons. As a multiple criteria measure under Pythagorean fuzzy uncertainty, the concept of overall preference indices is identified at the aggregation stage to exploit certain rules for generating PROMETHEE flows. Next, this paper provides effective Pythagorean fuzzy PROMETHEE I and II ranking procedures to determine partial and complete preorders, respectively, among competing alternatives. The developed Pythagorean fuzzy PROMETHEE-based outranking approach is comparatively validated using a real-world application concerning the selection problem of bridge construction methods. The solution results along with a comparison analysis demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms the comparative approach in terms of reasonability and stability. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the promising areas of improving the constructive and technological solutions of low-rise buildings is the fast-erecting systems. Increase of efficiency of the erection process of these systems can be implemented on the basis of the results of a multiple-criteria analysis of the organizational and technological processes by decomposing it into separate technological processes and operations and assessing their impact on the overall building erection process. The structure of a multiple-criteria model includes such indexes as the duration of separate technological processes and the operation of the overground part in the building erection. The subject of the study - technological operation parameters during the installation process of the transformable low-rise buildings with sandwich panel walls. Based on selection, classification, and systematization of the factors determining the resultant indicators, the relationship between the effective indicator (function) and the factors (arguments) was studied and their forms of dependence were determined based on the linkage modeling. The calculation of the influence of various factors and their assessment on the change in value of the effective indicator was performed. The selected factors include several parameters in the form of technological operations, which are expressed in hours. The simulation of technological process using a multiple-criteria model allows determining the efficiency reserves of the developed technology. Its application in installation control processes could help the construction industry with transformable low-rise building erection. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

abstract={In this article, a research was conducted on the importance of the initialization of population on the solutions resulting from an evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMOO). This means how the technique applied in the population's initialization can affect-supposed-optimized solutions after a certain number of iterations in a multi-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Knowing that Pareto front is the ideal to reach, the presented work propose to utilize a Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis method (MCDA) to sort or classify the initial population. To achieve this goal, an EMOO Framework is implemented which uses (i) conflicting optimization criteria, (ii) NSGAII as an EA and (iii) MR-sort method is used as a MCDA for classification. The experiments results clearly indicate that the proposed Framework is capable of producing an acceptable number of optimized design alternatives regarding the problem complexity and in a reasonable period. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Latent fingerprints have attracted considerable attention from researchers in the fields of forensics and law enforcement applications. Public demand for these applications may be the driving force behind further progress in biometrics research. Although great effort has been taken to devise algorithms for overlapped latent fingerprint classification system, there are still many challenging problems involved in fingerprint classification systems. Most of the fingerprint-based applications will prolong with fingerprint recognition because of its proven performance, the existence of large databases and the availability of the fingerprint devices with minimum cost. There are various issues that need to be addressed to develop fingerprint classification system. In this connection, there are some designing challenges such as nonlinear distortion, low-quality image, segmentation, sensor noise, skin conditions, overlapping, inter-class similarity, intra-class variations and template ageing. In crime scenes, the latent images can be overlapped with some background images or more number of fingerprint images from same person or different person. An overlapped fingerprint image should be processed for fingerprint classification. This proposed recognition system suggests multiple criteria decision analysis technique to assess the overlapped latent fingerprints. The proposed multiple criteria such as first-order, second-order and third-order features are used to classify the overlapped latent fingerprints. The proposed system designs the novel classification system for overlapped latent fingerprint images using ANFIS classifier. Extensive experiments are performed on the simultaneous latent fingerprint databases, and National Institute of Standards and Technology-Special Database 27, Fingerprint Verification Competition 2006 Database1-A and Database2-A databases. The planned work enables accurate and fast data retrieval by using one-to-N fingerprint classification for overlapped latent images. The experimental results are highly promising, and they outperform the existing systems in classifying overlapped images. The performance of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system classifier is evaluated by applying the k-fold cross-validation technique. The outcome of the work shows that the overlapped fingerprint is classified in a successful manner, and the results are compared with Bayes, SVM and MLP classifiers. The obtained results show that the proposed system achieves a better classification rate of 90.66% with 5 s, 86.66% with 12 s compared to the existing system. © 2018, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={A multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was developed for the selection of sanitation systems. This decision support system was aimed at assisting municipal engineers to design and implement sustainable solutions to meet a municipality’s obligation to provide free basic sanitation (FBS). Multi-attribute value theory (MAVT) was selected as the method most suited to the problem under consideration. Criteria which determine the sustainability of sanitation were selected from the literature and a spreadsheet-based MCDA with stakeholder and expert user interfaces was developed. Stakeholders determine the weighting of each indicator and expert users determine the values to be entered for the alternatives against each indicator. The partial values are aggregated using a weighted sum function. Research carried out into the implementation of FBS by the eThekwini Municipality that includes the city of Durban was analysed. This informed the allocation of indicator values to the sanitation alternatives under consideration: ventilated improved pit latrines (VIPs) and urine diversion dehydrating toilets (UDDTs). An innovative scenario analysis method was used to determine the effect of different weightings and/or values, representing changes in stakeholder involvement, resource recovery and political support for ecological sanitation. The MCDA was found to provide a guiding framework for municipal engineers in their efforts to implement sustainable sanitation. The process of deriving values for the MCDA is likely to prove even more useful than the overall value scores of the options under consideration. © 2018, South African Water Research Commission.

abstract={The increasing and often conflicting challenges that agricultural production systems face today require a more comprehensive approach to planning in the sector, integrating the economic principles of production with its social characteristics and ecological impacts. The paper presents an innovative attempt to incorporate biophysical criteria into a standard socio-economic optimisation model, illustrated through a study of the Slovenian dairy sector. The biophysical perspective on the system's functioning is determined by means of emergy analysis. This is an environmental accounting approach which reflects the cumulative environmental support needed to produce a certain output. The eco-centric perspective on the emergy approach complements the standard socioeconomic perspective of value that reflects the utility of a product (anthropocentric perspective). The model is developed based on a preceding analysis of socio-economic and emergy-based performance characteristics of different production types at the farm level that, when aggregated, constitute the sector. The multi-criteria optimisation model is supported by weighted goal programming (WGP) and aims to investigate the effects of two opposing agricultural policy paradigms on the organisation of the sector at the national level. The results show that a protectionist or eco-social focus of public interventions results in the sector's organisation with rather contrasting performance characteristics. The model outcome that represents a compromise between the two agro-political paradigms clearly suggests that incorporation of the emergy criterion into the optimisation model leads to a diverse and balanced structure and a more favourable economic and biophysical performance of the sector. Accordingly, the results confirm the complementarity of economic and emergy approaches and provide implications for a more comprehensive planning of agricultural activity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Nowadays modern monolithic construction is moving toward in balanced structural safety improving, energy efficiency and cost reduction with no-loss in quality characteristics. All this trends are possible due to bearing and enclosure wall construction technology optimization. Construction process efficiency is closely bounded with innovative material using both with a selection of effective work technology. To determine and justify the choice of material and construction technology researches are conducted. To select the most effective combination in the construction of enclosing building design, a multiple-criteria decision analysis of the work processability is used. The conducted numerical researches and the analysis of results have revealed that the most effective solution from the point of view of construction manufacturability of building enclosing structures and also which corresponds to the requirement of building heat protection is the using of monolith sandwich - multi-layered monolithic structure with a low-thermal conductivity concrete as a monolithic thermal insulation layer. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

abstract={This paper addresses the issue of selecting a suitable location for a fire station in canton of Fribourg, as a result of a fire brigades' merger, by applying Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods. Solving the problem of determining fire station locations through various methods has been analyzed in-depth by researchers. However, a different approach, based on application of ELECTRE I and ELECTRE II methods is advanced in this paper. The selection of the most suitable fire station site is obtained by applying the designated methods to five distinctive alternatives (called scenarios), taking into consideration the relatively limited information and specifics, and the extensive number of relevant criteria that summed up to sixty-one. Taking the merger of the three local fire departments as an example, the proposed methods for selecting a suitable location for the fire station demonstrate and justify the reason behind this choice. Research shows that the applied methods have been proven to be useful and powerful tools that exhibited acceptable levels of consistency when selecting the best project. The main finding is that one scenario in particular proved to be preferred over the others and most suitable in determining the fire station location. © 2018 Marino Widmer, published by Sciendo.},

abstract={Many multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods have been proposed over the last decades. Some of the most known methods share some similarities in the way they are used and configured. However, we live in a time of change and nowadays the decision-making process (especially when done in group) is even more demanding and dynamic. In this work, we propose a MCDA method that includes cognitive aspects (cognitive analytic process, CAP). By taking advantage of aspects such as expertise level, credibility and behaviour style of the decision-makers, we propose a method that relates these aspects with problem configurations (alternatives and criteria preferences) done by each decision-maker. In this work, we evaluated the CAP in terms of configuration costs and the capability to enhance the quality of the decision. We have used the satisfaction level as a metric to compare our method with other known MCDA methods in literature (utility function, AHP and TOPSIS). Our method proved to be capable to achieve higher satisfaction levels compared to other MCDA methods, especially when the decision suggested by CAP is different from the one proposed by those methods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to develop novel VIKOR-based methods for multiple criteria decision analysis involving Pythagorean fuzzy information. The concept of Pythagorean fuzzy sets possesses definite advantages in handling vagueness and complex uncertainty over well-known nonstandard fuzzy sets, such as intuitionistic fuzzy sets and interval-valued fuzzy sets. Taking the powerfulness of Pythagorean fuzzy sets into account when tackling imprecise and ambiguous information in multiple criteria decision-making problems, this paper proposes remoteness index-based Pythagorean fuzzy VIKOR methods, which are significantly different from the existing VIKOR techniques. The uniqueness of the proposed VIKOR methodology is the consideration of uncertain information represented by Pythagorean fuzzy values and the construction of certain valuable concepts of a generalized distance measure and displaced and fixed remoteness indices. A flexible and multipurpose definition of a distance measure for Pythagorean fuzzy information is presented based on the Minkowski distance model. The generalized Pythagorean fuzzy distance measure presented in this paper is then applied to establish useful concepts of remoteness indices, consisting of displaced positive- and negative-ideal remoteness indices as well as fixed positive- and negative-ideal remoteness indices. Unlike the canonical VIKOR ranking procedure, this paper provides a new way to rank candidate alternatives and determine the compromise solution depending on distinct preference structures for adapting to the particularities within the Pythagorean fuzzy environment. Several useful multiple criteria ranking indices, consisting of remoteness-based group utility, individual regret, and compromise indices, are developed to facilitate compromise ranking among alternatives. Four algorithmic procedures of the presented remoteness index-based Pythagorean fuzzy VIKOR methods are also provided in detail. Furthermore, some real-world applications and comparative analyses concerning a criteria satisfaction problem, two service quality and Internet stock performance evaluation problems, and two Internet stock and R&D project investment problems are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed methods in practice. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The opportunity to improve service quality using ITIL has led many organizations to invest in the implementation of this framework. Selecting a software tool for ITIL is still one of the most difficult decisions due to lack of meaningful evaluation criteria and guidelines to help on that decision, making this, one of the most important and error-triggering steps in this way. A multicriteria value model to evaluate software tools for ITIL using a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach based on MACBETH is then proposed to address this problem. A focus on the functionality of the tool to extract criteria from the literature to assess four representative software solutions for ITIL in the market is made along with its demonstration in a company of the bank sector. Finally, using Moody and Shanks Framework, the proposed method is evaluated showing that is suitable for evaluating software tools for ITIL. © Designing Digitalization, ISD 2018.

abstract={The theory of Pythagorean fuzzy sets possesses significant advantages in handling vagueness and complex uncertainty. Additionally, Pythagorean fuzzy information is useful to simulate the ambiguous nature of subjective judgments and measure the fuzziness and imprecision more flexibly. The aim of this research is to develop an effective assignment-based method using a novel concept of correlation-based precedence indices for conducting multiple criteria decision analysis within the Pythagorean fuzzy uncertain environment. Based on the ideas of information energy and correlations, this paper defines a novel concept of correlation-based precedence indices in the Pythagorean fuzzy context and discusses their desirable properties. Next, this paper presents some useful concepts of discordance indicators, weighted discordance indicators, comprehensive discordance indicators, and comprehensive discordance indices to construct a novel assignment model for acquiring a comprehensive ranking of candidate alternatives. As an application of the proposed assignment-based method, a practical example concerning a financing decision of working capital policies is provided to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness. © 2018, the Authors.},

abstract={Background. Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been identified as a prospective methodology for assist-ing decision makers in evaluating the benefits of new medicines in health technology assessment (HTA); however, limited empirical evidence exists from real-world applications. Objective. To test in practice a recently developed MCDA methodological framework for HTA, the Advance Value Framework, in a proof-of-concept case study with decision makers. Methods. A multi-attribute value theory methodology was adopted applying the MACBETH ques-tioning protocol through a facilitated decision-analysis modelling approach as part of a decision conference with four experts. Settings. The remit of the Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (Tandvårds-och läkemedels-förmånsverket [TLV]) was adopted but in addition supplementary value dimensions were considered. Patients. Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients were considered having received prior chemotherapy. Interventions. Abiraterone, cabazitaxel, and enzalutamide were evaluated as third-line treatments. Measurements. Participants’ value preferences were elicited involving criteria selection, options scoring, criteria weighting, and their aggregation. Results. Eight criteria attributes were finally included in the model relating to therapeutic impact, safety profile, socioeconomic impact, and innovation level with relative importance weights 44.5%, 33.3%, 14.8%, and 7.4% per cluster, respectively. Enzalutamide scored the highest overall weighted preference value score, followed by abiraterone and cabazitaxel. Dividing treatments’ overall weighted preference value scores by their costs derived ‘‘costs per unit of value’’ for ranking the treatments based on value-for-money grounds. Limitations. Study limitations included lack of comparative clinical effects across treatments and the small sample of participants. Conclusion. The Advance Value Framework has the prospects of facilitating the evaluation process in HTA and health care decision making; additional research is recommended to address technical challenges and optimize the use of MCDA for policy making. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to develop a novel consensus ranking method that uses a mixed choice strategy for multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) under complex uncertainty based on Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) sets. The majority of MCDA methods have focused almost exclusively on 'criterion-specific' choice tasks that are the tasks in which all alternatives are decomposed into distinct components and evaluated on specific criteria. However, in certain MCDA problems in practical applications, category-based choices tend to be more holistic in nature, especially in affective-like aspects. Therefore, this paper incorporates a mixed choice strategy (i.e., a combination of a category-based strategy and a criterion-specific strategy) into the core structure of the developed MCDA method. Furthermore, this paper utilizes the theory of Pythagorean fuzziness to provide a powerful modeling tool for complex and varied decision-making environments. Employing the developed concepts of a PF precedence index based on PF information and a disagreement indicator based on distances between rankings, this paper proposes a novel consensus ranking method by means of a comprehensive disagreement-based assignment model for addressing a mixed-choice-strategy-based MCDA problem in the PF context. As an application of the proposed methodology, a real-world case study of a luxury car selection problem is investigated. The application results, along with a comparative analysis, demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the developed approach, which is capable of handling hybrid category-based and criterion-specific choice tasks and managing complex uncertainty in practical situations. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to develop a novel compromise approach using correlation-based closeness indices for addressing multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problems of bridge construction methods under complex uncertainty based on interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IVPF) sets. The assessment of bridge construction methods requires the consideration of multiple alternatives and conflicting tangible and intangible criteria in intricate and varied circumstances. The concept of IVPF sets is capable of handling imprecise and ambiguous information and managing complex uncertainty in real-world applications. Inspired by useful ideas concerning information energies, correlations, and correlation coefficients, this paper constructs new concepts of correlation-based closeness indices for IVPF characteristics and investigates their desirable properties. These indices can be utilized to achieve anchored judgments in decision-making processes and to reflect a certain balance between connections with positive and negative ideal points of reference. Moreover, these indices can fully consider the amount of information associated with higher degrees of uncertainty and effectively fuse imprecise and ambiguous evaluative ratings to construct a meaningful comparison approach. By using the correlation-based closeness index, this paper establishes effective algorithmic procedures of the proposed IVPF compromise approach for conducting multiple-criteria evaluation tasks within IVPF environments. The proposed methodology is implemented in a practical problem of selecting a suitable bridge construction method to demonstrate its feasibility and applicability. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed methodology are verified through a comparative analysis with well-known compromise methods and other relevant nonstandard fuzzy models. © 2018 Ting-Yu Chen.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to develop a novel correlation-based compromise approach for addressing multiple criteria decision analysis problems under complex uncertainty based on Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Based on the concepts of information energy and correlations for Pythagorean fuzzy characteristics, this paper proposes useful correlation-based compromise indices and investigates their desirable properties. These compromise indices can be employed to underlie anchored judgments and to reflect a certain balance between the correlations with positive-ideal and negative-ideal points of reference. Moreover, they can fully take into consideration the amount of information associated with higher degrees of uncertainty and can effectively fuse subjective assessments conveyed by Pythagorean fuzziness. From two different perspectives of displaced and fixed ideals, this paper provides two algorithmic procedures of the proposed correlation-based compromise approach for conducting multiple criteria evaluation tasks within Pythagorean fuzzy environments. A real-world problem concerning a financing decision on working capital policies is investigated to show the feasibility and applicability of the developed techniques. The application results, along with a comparative analysis, demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed methodology. © 2018-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problem is studied in this paper, for which the evaluation results obey a particular distribution. First, when solving a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problem, a grey target decision analysis framework is proposed to determine uncertain parameters and criteria weights. A measurement for comprehensive off-target distance is defined, which includes the undetermined parameters. Second, to satisfy the requirements of a specific distribution (such as a normal distribution) in the assessment results, an optimization model that incorporates the off-target distance constraints is proposed by considering the skewness and kurtosis test method. Third, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is extended to solve the proposed model by seeking the appropriate parameters and weights. Fourth, a numerical example is applied to demonstrate the feasibility and application of the proposed method. In the end, the proposed model is extended to other distribution requirements. © 2018 Wang He-Hua et al.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper was to develop a likelihood-based assignment method based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets and apply it to decision-making problems involving multiple criteria evaluation and the ranking/selection of alternatives. The linear assignment method is a well-known outranking method in the field of multiple criteria decision analysis. The theory of interval type-2 fuzzy sets is useful for addressing the uncertainty and imprecision associated with a subjective environment. In this paper, the key feature of the proposed method is the incorporation of the extended concept of likelihoods of fuzzy preference relations between interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers into the main structure of the linear assignment methodology. An effective ranking procedure using the optimal membership degree determination method is proposed to determine criterion-wise preference rankings of the alternatives. The proposed method establishes the novel concepts of an (adjusted) rank frequency matrix and an (adjusted) rank contribution matrix to combine the relative performances of the alternatives in terms of each criterion. Based on a signed distance comparison approach, this paper constructs a likelihood-based assignment model to obtain an aggregate ranking of the alternatives that is in the closest agreement with the criterion-wise preferences of the alternatives. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed method are illustrated with two practical multiple criteria decision-making applications concerning the selection of landfill sites and the selection of treatment options. Finally, a comparative analysis with other relevant methods is conducted to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the current methods in decision aiding. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

abstract={Background: Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) has appeared as a methodology to address limitations of economic evaluation in health technology assessment (HTA), however there are limited empirical evidence from real world applications. The aim of this study is to test in practice a recently developed MCDA methodological framework known as Advance Value Framework (AVF) through a proof-of-concept case study engaging multiple stakeholders. Methods: A multi-attribute value theory methodological process was adopted involving problem structuring, model building, model assessment and model appraisal phases. A facilitated decision analysis modelling approach was used as part of a decision conference with thirteen participants. An expanded scope of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) remit acted as the study setting with the use of supplementary value concerns. Second-line biological treatments were evaluated for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients having received prior chemotherapy, including cetuximab monotherapy, panitumumab monotherapy and aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI chemotherapy. Initially 18 criteria attributes were considered spanning four value domains relating to therapeutic impact, safety profile, innovation level and socioeconomic impact. Results: Nine criteria attributes were finally included. Cetuximab scored the highest overall weighted preference value score of 45.7 out of 100, followed by panitumumab with 42.3, and aflibercept plus FOLFIRI with 14.4. The relative weights of the two most important criteria (overall survival and Grade 4 adverse events) added up to more than the relative weight of all other criteria together (52.1%). Main methodological limitation was the lack of comparative clinical effects across treatments and challenges included the selection of "lower" and "higher" reference levels on criteria attributes, eliciting preferences across attributes where participants had less experience, and ensuring that all attributes possess the right decision theory properties. Conclusions: This first application of AVF produced transparent rankings for three mCRC treatments based on their value, by assessing an explicit set of evaluation criteria while allowing for the elicitation and construction of participants' value preferences and their trade-offs. It proved it can aid the evaluation process and value communication of the alternative treatments for the group participants. Further research is needed to optimise its use as part of policy-making. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={This work looks at coupling Life cycle assessment (LCA) with a dynamic inventory and multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to improve the validity and reliability of single score results for complex systems. This is done using the case study of a representative Danish single family home over the service life of the building. This case study uses both the established and the coupled MCDA assessment methods to quantify and assess the balance of impacts between the production of mineral wool insulation versus the production of space heat. The use of TOPSIS method for calculating single scores is proposed as an alternative to the ReCiPe single score impact assessment method. Based on the single score impact values obtained from both of these methods, various insulation levels are ranked to determine an ideal insulation level and gauge the effectiveness of environmental impact reduction measures in current Danish building regulations. Using a comparison of the results from the two methods, a preferred choice of impact assessment method is determined. The findings show that if the midpoint impacts for a particular scenario are strongly correlated with a climate change impact indicator, it does not matter which impact assessment is applied. However, for the scenarios where other impact categories vary inversely or independently from the climate change impact indicator, such as with renewable energy production, there is need for a more unconventional method, such as the TOPSIS method, for calculating single score impacts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The main purpose of this paper is to improve the production planning of Pakistan Tobacco Company by selecting the most preferred brand and subsequently generating maximum profit from it. As the company produces a variety of products, the technique of multi criteria decision making is used to select the most preferred brand. To generate the maximum output from the preferred brand, different methods of qualitative managerial analysis are used, which include decision analysis to decide “why and where” the manufacturing should be carried out, transportation model to minimize the logistics cost while meeting the demand, and linear programming technique to maximize the profit generated in 2014–2015. The result obtained from analytical hierarchy process shows that the most preferred brand of the company with respect to price, quality, and comfort is John Player Gold Leaf. The decision analysis explains that this brand should be manufactured in the Jhelum factory of the company as it is more cost-effective to produce and there is a high availability of resources. Transportation model minimizes the logistics cost of this brand from the 2 factories while meeting the demand at each provinces, central warehouse. Linear programming contributes in generating a profit of 32.738 billion PKR with an amount of 0.35 million PKR, which is more than that of the current profit of the company in the year. These results will allow the top management of the company to take corrective decisions well in time, gain a core competency in cost reduction, and make the supply chain process more efficient.

abstract={Escalating drug prices have catalysed the generation of numerous “value frameworks” with the aim of informing payers, clinicians and patients on the assessment and appraisal process of new medicines for the purpose of coverage and treatment selection decisions. Although this is an important step towards a more inclusive Value Based Assessment (VBA) approach, aspects of these frameworks are based on weak methodologies and could potentially result in misleading recommendations or decisions. In this paper, a Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methodological process, based on Multi Attribute Value Theory (MAVT), is adopted for building a multi-criteria evaluation model. A five-stage model-building process is followed, using a top-down “value-focused thinking” approach, involving literature reviews and expert consultations. A generic value tree is structured capturing decision-makers’ concerns for assessing the value of new medicines in the context of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and in alignment with decision theory. The resulting value tree (Advance Value Tree) consists of three levels of criteria (top level criteria clusters, mid-level criteria, bottom level sub-criteria or attributes) relating to five key domains that can be explicitly measured and assessed: (a) burden of disease, (b) therapeutic impact, (c) safety profile (d) innovation level and (e) socioeconomic impact. A number of MAVT modelling techniques are introduced for operationalising (i.e. estimating) the model, for scoring the alternative treatment options, assigning relative weights of importance to the criteria, and combining scores and weights. Overall, the combination of these MCDA modelling techniques for the elicitation and construction of value preferences across the generic value tree provides a new value framework (Advance Value Framework) enabling the comprehensive measurement of value in a structured and transparent way. Given its flexibility to meet diverse requirements and become readily adaptable across different settings, the Advance Value Framework could be offered as a decision-support tool for evaluators and payers to aid coverage and reimbursement of new medicines. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Borehole microseismic monitoring is a widely used method in the oil and gas industry to monitor hydraulic fracturing operations. Sometimes, the quality of acquired microseismic data is relatively poor due to lack of proper survey design. The authors provide a comprehensive and thorough workflow, using multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), to optimize microseismic acquisition design. The result of this work is a software application, that will help the user determine optimized locations for placing receivers in observation wellbores. © 2017 SEG.},

abstract={Reversible moldboard plows are often equipped with a wheel assembly that is used to adjust the working depth and help the device in transportation. This research is focused on optimization of the wheel assembly to solve the problem of deformation and hydraulic system damages caused by crash of wheel and plow body when rotating at the head lands. For this purpose, brain-storming raised five primary ideas which one of them considered as final idea during a multi-criteria decision making process. Vibration tests of optimized plow showed that the mechanism was successful in reducing the crash energy up to ten times.},

abstract={Building effective digital economy infrastructure is currently a basic condition for improving international competitiveness of middle income countries that want to close their development gap and avoid the problem of a middle income trap. From the national perspective, investing in digital economy can be a tool which supports sustainable development and increases the speed of convergence process at regional level. In this context, comparative research on development of the digital economy, both at national and regional level, should be considered as an actual and important scientific task. Therefore, the main aim of the article is to assess and compare the development level of digital economy in Visegrad countries at regional level (NUTS 1). In the research, the digital economy is defined as a multiple-criteria phenomenon. As a result, in the empirical research, the TOPSIS method with application of generalized distance measure GDM was used. The data for diagnostic variables concerning digital infrastructure in the years 2012 and 2015 was provided by Eurostat. On the one hand, the analysis confirmed a relatively quick progress in building digital economy at regional level in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. On the other hand, significant disparities between the analyzed regions can be seen, especially in case of Polish regions. © 2016 Journal of Competitiveness. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to develop an approach to solve the multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problems under the hesitant fuzzy environment, in which the criteria values take the form of the hesitant fuzzy elements (HFEs) and the information about criteria weights are correlative. Based on the λ-fuzzy measure, we firstly get the weight vector of the criteria. Secondly, we propose the linear assignment method to acquire the optimal preference ranking of the alternatives according to a set of criteria-wise rankings and a set of criteria importance within the context of HFEs on the basis of the Hesitant Euclidean distance. Finally, a practical example about talent introduction is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness. © 2016, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) are powerful tools in managing simultaneous sources of vagueness. Inspired by HFSs, interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic sets (IVHFLSs) combine linguistic term sets and interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets (IVHFSs) together to flexibly characterize uncertain information from simultaneous sources. The purpose of this paper is to investigate effective ways to aggregate such uncertain information and then apply them to multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). First, two interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic Choquet integrals are proposed to characterize the interdependent characteristics between criteria. Then, based on the Shapley fuzzy measures, we develop two kinds of generalized interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic Shapley Choquet integrals to globally characterize interactions between criteria combinations. A model designed to obtain the optimal Shapley fuzzy measures is then constructed. Furthermore, an approach to interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic MCDA is developed based on the proposed aggregation operators. Finally, a numerical example and a detailed discussion are provided to illustrate the application of the proposed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The theory of interval type-2 fuzzy sets provides an intuitive and computationally feasible method of addressing uncertain and ambiguous information in decision-making fields. This paper aims to develop a prioritised interval type-2 fuzzy aggregation operator and apply it to multiple criteria decision analysis with prioritised criteria. This paper considers situations in which a relationship between the criteria exists such that a lack of satisfaction by the higher priority criteria cannot be readily compensated by the satisfaction of lower priority criteria. This paper introduces the developed prioritised interval type-2 fuzzy aggregation operator to address the problem of criteria aggregation in this environment. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed operator, this paper provides a multiple criteria decision-making method that uses the prioritised interval type-2 fuzzy aggregation operator, and the method is illustrated with a practical application to landfill site selection. © 2017 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.},

abstract={Background and Aim: Due to the limitations of financial resources in medical centers in the country, considering the utilization of beds and hospital bed occupancy rate are considered extremely important. This study was conducted in order to determine the affecting factors of bed occupation index using Multiple Criteria Decision Making approach in a military hospital. Methods: This research was a descriptive study, which was conducted during 2015. The statistical population consisted of the chief executive manager, top manager, training supervisor and the heads of all the inpatient wards. Eighteen subjects were selected in the study through the census method. The gathering data tool was the comparisons questionnaire for factors affecting bed occupation, which its face and content validity were confirmed using experts' opinions. Data analysis were done using the Expert Choice software V11. Results: Eighteen subjects participated as samples in this study which consisted of 2 managers, 10 nurses and nursing directors, and 6 healthcare management experts. Six main criteria were defined for determining the affecting factors of bed occupation index including: clinic activation, Physician staff, financial access, the type of hospital and its services, the disease in the region and an active emergency. Among the main criteria, financial access had the highest geometric mean or priority (0.214) and clinic activation had the lowest geometric mean or priority (0.129). Conclusion: According to the 6 criteria mentioned as the affecting factors in the bed occupancy rate, In addition to providing high -quality services and enough insurance coverage, hospitals must pay more attention to more active clinics and emergencies as the input of patients to hospitals.},

abstract={The TODIM is a valuable technique for solving classical MCDM problems in case of considering the decision maker’s psychological behavior. One main goal of this chapter is to introduce the measured functions-based hesitant fuzzy TODIM technique to deal with the behavioral MCDM problem under hesitant fuzzy environments. The main advantages of this technique are that (1) it can handle the MCDM problems in which the ratings of alternatives with respect to each criterion are represented by HFEs or IVHFEs and (2) it can take the decision maker’s psychological behavior into account. Another aim of this chapter is to present the hesitant trapezoidal fuzzy TODIM method with a closeness index-based ranking approach to handle MCGDM problems in which decision data is expressed as comparative linguistic expressions based on HTrFNs. This proposed method first transforms comparative linguistic expressions into HTrFNs for carrying out computing with word processes. Then, a closeness index-based ranking method is proposed for comparing the magnitude of HTrFNs. By using such a ranking method, the dominance values of alternatives over others for each expert are calculated. Next, a nonlinear programming model is established to derive the dominance values of alternatives over others for the group and correspondingly the optimal ranking order of alternatives is determined. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

abstract={The LINMAP technique is one of the most representative methods for handling the MCDM or MCGDM problems with respect to the preference information over alternatives. This chapter utilizes the main structure of LINMAP to develop the hesitant fuzzy group LINMAP technique with interval programming model and the hesitant fuzzy programming model-based LINMAP technique. The former is mainly used to solve the MCGDM problems in which the ratings of alternatives with respect to criteria are taken as HFEs, and all pair-wise comparison judgments are represented by interval numbers. While the latter is mainly utilized to address the MCDM problems with incomplete weight information in which the ratings of alternatives with each criterion are taken as HFEs and the incomplete judgments on pair-wise comparisons of alternatives with hesitant degrees are also represented by HFEs. The main contributions of this chapter are that (1) the developed techniques not only can take sufficiently into account the experts’ hesitancy in expressing their assessment information for criteria values by using HFEs but also can simultaneously consider the uncertainty of preference information over alternatives by using interval numbers or HFEs; (2) the concept of hesitant fuzzy programming model in which both the objective function and the constraints’ coefficients take the form of HFEs has been proposed, and an effective technique to solve this sort of model is developed; (3) the bi-objective programming model has been constructed to address the issues of incomplete and inconsistent weights of the criteria. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

abstract={HFE which allows the membership degree of an element to a set represented by several possible values is a powerful tool to describe and deal with uncertain data. This chapter develops the decision making approach based on TOPSIS and the maximizing deviation model for solving MCDM problems in which the evaluation information provided by the decision maker is expressed in HFEs and the information about criteria weights is incomplete. There are two key issues being addressed in this approach. The first one is to establish an optimization model based on the maximizing deviation method, which can be used to determine the weights of criteria. The second one is to calculate the revised closeness index of each alternative to the hesitant fuzzy PIS. The considered alternatives are ranked according to the revised closeness indices of alternatives and the most desirable one is selected. An important advantage of this proposed method is its ability to relieve the influence of subjectivity of the decision maker concerning the weights of criteria and at the same time to remain the original decision information sufficiently. Additionally, the extended results in the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy situations are also pointed out. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

abstract={The QUALIFLEX is a very useful outranking method to deal simultaneously with the cardinal and ordinal information in decision making process. The purpose of this chapter is to develop the hesitant fuzzy QUALIFLEX with a signed distance-based comparison method for handling MCDM problems in which both the assessments of alternatives on criteria and the weights of criteria are expressed by HFEs. In this chapter, we propose the novel concept of hesitancy index for the HFE to measure the degree of hesitancy of the decision-maker or the decision organization. By taking their hesitancy indices into account, we present a signed distance-based ranking method to compare the magnitude of HFEs. By adopting such a comparison approach, the hesitant fuzzy QUALIFLEX technique is developed. Compared with the hesitant fuzzy ELECTRE method, to handle the MCDM problems where the number of criteria markedly exceeds the number of alternatives the developed technique does not require the complicated computation procedures but still yields a reasonable and credible solution. Finally, the developed technique is extended to manage the heterogeneous information including real numbers, interval numbers, TFNs, IFNs, and HFEs. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

abstract={This textbook presents methodologies and applications associated with multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), especially for those students with an interest in industrial engineering. With respect to methodology, the book covers (1) problem structuring methods; (2) methods for ranking multi-dimensional deterministic outcomes including multiattribute value theory, the analytic hierarchy process, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and outranking techniques; (3) goal programming,; (4) methods for describing preference structures over single and multi-dimensional probabilistic outcomes (e.g., utility functions); (5) decision trees and influence diagrams; (6) methods for determining input probability distributions for decision trees, influence diagrams, and general simulation models; and (7) the use of simulation modeling for decision analysis. This textbook also offers: Easy to follow descriptions of how to apply a wide variety of MCDA techniques Specific examples involving multiple objectives and/or uncertainty/risk of interest to industrial engineers A section on outranking techniques ; this group of techniques, which is popular in Europe, is very rarely mentioned as a methodology for MCDA in the United States A chapter on simulation as a useful tool for MCDA, including ranking & selection procedures. Such material is rarely covered in courses in decision analysis Both material review questions and problems at the end of each chapter . Solutions to the exercises are found in the Solutions Manual which will be provided along with PowerPoint slides for each chapter. The methodologies are demonstrated through the use of applications of interest to industrial engineers, including those involving product mix optimization, supplier selection, distribution center location and transportation planning, resource allocation and scheduling of a medical clinic, staffing of a call center, quality control, project management, production and inventory control,and so on. Specifically, industrial engineering problems are structured as classical problems in multiple criteria decision analysis, and the relevant methodologies are demonstrated. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

abstract={This study takes a holistic approach to provide decision support for selecting recycling practices that are suitable for urban settlement without mandatory recycling, such as Thailand. The study employed analytic hierarchical process (AHP) to nominate the most optimal informal recycling modes for municipal solid waste (MSW), namely, itinerant recyclable buying (IRB), recycling center buying (RCB), and donation to charity (DOC). Studies of MSW characteristic at landfills, willingness to pay and recycling attitudes using questionnaire surveys (n = 1063), and reviews of existing MSW management system were carried out in three urban settlements, classified as peri-urban (PS), urban (US), and metropolis (MS), that differ in size and administrative capacity in Thailand. Findings from the above studies were then used for creating AHP's evaluating criteria as willingness to recycle (WTR), potential reduction of landfill cost (C-MSW), and additional willingness to pay for the implementation of a recycling system (A-WTP). For WTR, we found that recycling modes with monetary return, IRB and RCB, remained the preferred venue of recycling as they consistently ranked higher than non-monetary return option (DNO) in all sites. For C-MSW, the result indicated that the choice of IRB were able to save the cost of waste management as IRB tended to induce highest diversion rates in all three sites. For A-WTP, the study found that respondents who opted to recycle via IRB were often commended the highest WTP compared to other mode of recycling in all sites. The final AHP scores (PS:IRB = 0.75,RCB = 0.13; US:IRB = 0.56; RCB = 0.35; MS: IRB = 0.65; RCB = 0.13) for all sites indicated that IRB was the most optimal option to promote recycling. Therefore, itinerant recyclable buying is a recommended option for all urban settlements as an effective, informal MSW collection activity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Considerable literature exists regarding the complexity of the residential real estate appraisal process and the methods employed to determine initial listing prices as estimates of intrinsic market prices. Deviations in residential real estate intrinsic values occur due to a multiplicity of attributes and explanatory factors requiring consideration. We conduct a panel study using a Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) based framework that utilizes the skills and knowledge of a panel of residential real estate professionals (i.e. appraisers and realtors). We demonstrate how cognitive mapping and the Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique (MACBETH) may assist in estimating appropriate offer/sale prices and strengthening current valuation approaches such as using comparables and/or hedonic modeling. The managerial implications of our MCDA-based framework and some avenues for future research are also presented. © 2016 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.},

abstract={We focus here on the application of multi critera decision analysis (MCDA) techniques in hardware/software partitioning activities to be used in the design and deployment of embedded systems. Our goal is to identify the best existing methods and tools suitable to support the approach we have taken for the partitioning process. We provide this via a survey of the most well-known MCDA methods and tools (for a specific class of MCDA methods called multi attribute decision making. We identify a set of criteria that need to be addressed, in some way, by the methods, and implemented by related tools. These “11-suitability criteria” help us in deciding the appropriateness of the analysed methods and tools for the envisaged partitioning approach. In brief, we are interested that the MCDA methods are taking into account multiple extra-functional properties, expressed by a variety of types, with possible missing values, should enable dependency handling, decision traceability, etc. The conclusion is that there are criteria that are not fulfilled by any of the methods, and hence there is no method or tool that can directly used for the partitioning. However, the results shows the potential of using MCDA in the partitioning process and provide a good starting point for future research activities. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The emerging ubiquity of geospatial information is providing an unprecedented opportunity to apply Geographical Information Systems (GIS)-based multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to a broad spectrum of use cases. Volunteered geographic information, open GIS software, geoservice-based tools, cloud-based virtualized platforms, and worldwide collaboration of both domain experts and general users have greatly increased the quantity and accessibility of geospatially referenced data resources. Currently, there is a lack of GIS-based MCDA tools that integrate this decision-driven process within a widely accessible, robust geoframework environment, designed for user-friendly interaction. In this contribution, we present a conceptual workflow and proof-of-concept software application, Geocentric Environment for Analysis and Reasoning (GEAR), which provides a viable transition path to enhance geospatial MCDA in the age of open GIS. We propose a Web-based platform that leverages open-source geotechnologies to incorporate a wide variety of geospatial data formats in a common solution space to allow for spatially enhanced and time-relevant decision analysis. Through the proposed workflow, a user can ingest and modify heterogeneous data formats, exploit temporally tagged data sources, create multicriteria decision analysis models, and visualize the results in an iterative and collaborative workspace. A sample case study applied to disaster relief is used to demonstrate the prototype and workflow. This proof-of-concept Web-based application provides a notional pathway of how to connect open-source data to open-source analysis through a geospatially enabled MCDA workflow that could be virtually accessible to many levels of decision makers from individuals to entire organizations. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to develop a projection-based compromising method for addressing multiple criteria decision-making problems based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The concept of projections considers not only the distance but also the included angle between evaluative ratings of alternative actions with respect to a criterion. In the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy context, this paper determines the respective projections of the evaluative ratings of each alternative on the positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions and explores several essential properties. Next, this paper introduces the concepts of projection-based compromising indices and comprehensive compromising indices and further investigates relevant theorems for supporting the usefulness of these indices. Additionally, this paper proposes the projection-based comparative index and the comprehensive comparative index to serve as benchmark values for the comparison purpose. The improvement percentage of the comprehensive compromising value is acquired to determine the priority order of the alternatives, including the complete ranking order and the approval status for each alternative. The feasibility and the applicability of the proposed method are validated with an application problem of watershed site selection. Finally, several comparative analyses are conducted to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method over other relevant compromising decision-making methods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Tourism is one of the most climate-sensitive economic sectors, but also a contributor to climate change. With the effects of climate change becoming an increasing concern, the tourism sector must urgently and realistically respond by mitigating its emissions and adapting tourism businesses and destinations to the changing climate conditions. This work presents a generic methodological framework to plan, manage and implement climate change mitigation and adaptation measures in the tourism context. The methodological scheme is based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis for prioritizing available options applicable to a defined tourism area. The proposed framework is implemented for Greece, one of the world's most popular tourism destinations, and optimally ranks 18 mitigation and 16 adaptation measures under 4 criteria i.e. environmental benefit, applicability, cost and social acceptance. The analysis indicates that rational energy use, improvement of energy efficiency and water management/saving measures should be primarily put forward for the Greek case. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods, such as ELECTRE, PROMETEE, AHP, TOPSIS, VIKOR, have been applied to solving numerous real-life decision making problems in business and management. However, the mechanics of those methods is not easily understandable and it is often seen by users without much formal training as a kind of "scientific witchcraft". In order to make those popular MCDA methods more transparent, we provide a simple framework for interpretations of rankings they produce. The framework builds on the classical results of MCDA, in particular on the preference capture mechanism proposed by Zionts and Wallenius in seventies of the last century, based on Simple Additive Weighting. The essence and the potential impact of our contribution is that given a ranking produced by an MCDA method, we show how to derive weights for the Simple Additive Weighting which yield the same ranking as the given method. In that way we establish a common framework for almost no-cost posterior analysis, interpretation and comparison of rankings produced by MCDA methods in the expert systems environment. We show the working of the concept taking the TOPSIS method in focus, but it applies in the same way to any other MCDM method. We illustrate our reasoning with numerical examples taken from literature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Hong Kong has great potential to develop ecotourism as an alternate tourism experience. In order to provide visitors with satisfaction and conserve and sustain natural resources, a comprehensive zoning plan is indispensable to identify areas for various purposes and activities. Geographic information system combined with multi-criteria decision analysis procedure can be used to formulate these plans in an objective and efficient way. This study used this approach to objectively identify potential sites for various ecotourism activities and tourism development potential in Lantau Island, Hong Kong SAR. The results were then used to evaluate the Lantau development plan proposed by the government. By integrating with quality conservation information, the island was further classified into four zones namely sanctuary, nature conservation, outdoor recreation, and tourism development through multi-objective analysis. The results showed that proposed sites for various recreational activities are of medium to high suitability, while other potential sites with high suitability were revealed. In addition, sites with conflicting objectives and those required further protection were also identified. The results can be used as an unbiased guide for Lantau development. This study also demonstrated ecotourism planning and development can be practically supported by geo-information tools combined with proper multi-criteria decision analysis procedures based on which better decision can be made. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={Abstract: The theory of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets provides an intuitive and feasible way of addressing uncertain and ambiguous properties. Many useful models and methods have been developed for multiple criteria decision analysis within the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment. In contrast to the elaborate existing methods, this paper establishes a simple and effective method for managing the sophisticated data expressed by interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. An inclusion comparison possibility defined on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets is proposed, and some important properties are investigated. Then, an inclusion-based index that considers positive and negative ideals is offered. Considering the maximal comprehensive inclusion-based indices, this paper constructs a linear programming model (for consistent information) and an integrated, nonlinear programming model (for inconsistent information) to estimate the criterion weights and the optimal ranking order of the alternatives under an incomplete preference structure. The feasibility of the proposed method is illustrated by a practical example of selecting a suitable bridge construction method, and a comparative analysis with other relevant methods is conducted to validate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methodology. © 2016 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.},

abstract={This paper presents an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy permutation method with likelihood-based preference functions for managing multiple criteria decision analysis based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. First, certain likelihood-based preference functions are proposed using the likelihoods of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relationships. Next, selected practical indices of concordance/discordance are established to evaluate all possible permutations of the alternatives. The optimal priority order of the alternatives is determined by comparing all comprehensive concordance/discordance values based on score functions. Furthermore, this paper considers various preference types and develops another interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy permutation method using programming models to address multiple criteria decision-making problems with incomplete preference information. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods are illustrated in the problem of selecting a suitable bridge construction method. Moreover, certain comparative analyses are conducted to verify the advantages of the proposed methods compared with those of other decision-making methods. Finally, the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with a risk assessment problem in new product development. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In recent years, multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) has emerged as a likely alternative to address shortcomings in health technology assessment (HTA) by offering a more holistic perspective to value assessment and acting as an alternative priority setting tool. In this paper, we argue that MCDA needs to subscribe to robust methodological processes related to the selection of objectives, criteria and attributes in order to be meaningful in the context of healthcare decision making and fulfil its role in value-based assessment (VBA). We propose a methodological process, based on multi-attribute value theory (MAVT) methods comprising five distinct phases, outline the stages involved in each phase and discuss their relevance in the HTA process. Importantly, criteria and attributes need to satisfy a set of desired properties, otherwise the outcome of the analysis can produce spurious results and misleading recommendations. Assuming the methodological process we propose is adhered to, the application of MCDA presents three very distinct advantages to decision makers in the context of HTA and VBA: first, it acts as an instrument for eliciting preferences on the performance of alternative options across a wider set of explicit criteria, leading to a more complete assessment of value; second, it allows the elicitation of preferences across the criteria themselves to reflect differences in their relative importance; and, third, the entire process of preference elicitation can be informed by direct stakeholder engagement, and can therefore reflect their own preferences. All features are fully transparent and facilitate decision making. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={The main objective of this study was to evaluate the suitability and select the most appropriate areas for building campgrounds in Kuerdening, China. To achieve this aim, AHP and GIS-based weighted overlay methods were adopted. AHP was used to determine the weights of the indexes, and ArcGIS 10 was used to calculate and map the campground suitability. In pursuit of minimum environmental effects and sustainable development, this paper identifies four factors to evaluate the suitability of areas for building campgrounds: natural environment condition, landscape condition, safety condition and infrastructure condition. The final outcome of this studywas the suitability map for building campgrounds. This research not only provides a theoretical guide for the construction of campgrounds in this area but also provides a scientific and efficientworkflow to evaluate the appropriateness of other areas. The result is reasonable and operable for camping facilities development and also useful for managers and planners working in local governments as well as investors. © Wang Cuirong et al., published by De Gruyter Open 2016.},

abstract={The complexity of water resources management increases when decisions about environmental and social issues are considered in addition to economic efficiency. Such complexities are further compounded by multiple uncertainties about the consequences of potential management decisions. In this paper, a new fuzzy-stochastic multiple criteria decision-making approach is proposed for water resources management in which a variety of criteria in terms of economic, environmental and social dimensions are identified and taken into account. The goal is to evaluate multiple conflicting criteria under uncertainties and to rank a set of management alternatives. The methodology uses a simulation-optimization water management model of a strongly interacting groundwater-agriculture system to enumerate criteria based on these bio-physical process interactions. Fuzzy and/or qualitative information regarding the decision-making process for which quantitative data is not available are evaluated in linguistic terms. Afterwards, Monte Carlo simulation is applied to combine these information and to generate a probabilistic decision matrix of management alternatives versus criteria in an uncertain environment. Based on this outcome, total performance values of the management alternatives are calculated using ordered weighted averaging. The proposed approach is applied to a real world example, where excessive groundwater withdrawal from the coastal aquifer for irrigated agriculture has resulted in saltwater intrusion, threatening the economical basis of farmers and associated societal impacts. The analysis has provided potential decision alternatives which can serve as a platform for negotiation and further exploration. Furthermore, sensitivity of different inputs to resulting rankings is investigated. It is found that decision makers’ risk aversion and risk taking attitude may yield different rankings. The presented approach suits to systematically quantify both probabilistic and fuzzy uncertainties associated with complex hydrosystems management. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Background: The objective of this study was to assess the potential impact of the implementation of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) on the Polish pricing and reimbursement (P&R) process with regard to orphan drugs. Methods: A four step approach was designed. Firstly, a systematic literature review was conducted to select the MCDA criteria. Secondly, a database of orphan drugs was established. Thirdly, health technology appraisals (HTA recommendations) were categorized and an MCDA appraisal was conducted. Finally, a comparison of HTA and MCDA outcomes was carried out. An MCDA outcome was considered positive if more than 50 % of the maximum number of points was reached (base case). In the sensitivity analysis, 25 % and 75 % thresholds were tested as well. Results: Out of 2242 publications, 23 full-text articles were included. The final MCDA tool consisted of ten criteria. In total, 27 distinctive drug-indication pairs regarding 21 drugs were used for the study. Six negative and 21 positive HTA recommendations were issued. In the base case, there were 19 positive MCDA outcomes. Of the 27 cases, there were 12 disagreements between the HTA and MCDA outcomes, the majority of which related to positive HTA guidance for negative MCDA outcomes. All drug-indication pairs with negative HTA recommendations were appraised positively in the MCDA framework. Economic details were available for 12 cases, of which there were 9 positive MCDA outcomes. Amongst the 12 drug-indication pairs, two were negatively appraised in the HTA process, with positive MCDA guidance, and two were appraised in the opposite direction. Conclusions: An MCDA approach may lead to different P&R outcomes compared to a standard HTA process. On the one hand, enrichment of the list of decision making criteria means further scrutiny of a given health technology and as such increases the odds of a negative P&R outcome. On the other hand, it may uncover additional values and as such increase the odds of positive P&R outcomes. © 2016 Kolasa et al.},

abstract={Health care decisions are complex and involve confronting trade-offs between multiple, often conflicting objectives. Using structured, explicit approaches to decisions involving multiple criteria can improve the quality of decision making. A set of techniques, known under the collective heading, multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), are useful for this purpose. In 2014, ISPOR established an Emerging Good Practices Task Force. The task force's first report defined MCDA, provided examples of its use in health care, described the key steps, and provided an overview of the principal methods of MCDA. This second task force report provides emerging good-practice guidance on the implementation of MCDA to support health care decisions. The report includes: a checklist to support the design, implementation and review of an MCDA; guidance to support the implementation of the checklist; the order in which the steps should be implemented; illustrates how to incorporate budget constraints into an MCDA; provides an overview of the skills and resources, including available software, required to implement MCDA; and future research directions. © 2016 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).},

abstract={Effective watershed management requires the evaluation of agricultural best management practice (BMP) scenarios which carefully consider the relevant environmental, economic, and social criteria involved. In the Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) process, scenarios are first evaluated and then ranked to determine the most desirable outcome for the particular watershed. The main challenge of this process is the accurate identification of the best solution for the watershed in question, despite the various risk attitudes presented by the associated decision-makers (DMs). This paper introduces a novel approach for implementation of the MCDM process based on a comparative neutral risk/risk-based decision analysis, which results in the selection of the most desirable scenario for use in the entire watershed. At the sub-basin level, each scenario includes multiple BMPs with scores that have been calculated using the criteria derived from two cases of neutral risk and risk-based decision-making. The simple additive weighting (SAW) operator is applied for use in neutral risk decision-making, while the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) and induced OWA (IOWA) operators are effective for risk-based decision-making. At the watershed level, the BMP scores of the sub-basins are aggregated to calculate each scenarios' combined goodness measurements; the most desirable scenario for the entire watershed is then selected based on the combined goodness measurements. Our final results illustrate the type of operator and risk attitudes needed to satisfy the relevant criteria within the number of sub-basins, and how they ultimately affect the final ranking of the given scenarios. The methodology proposed here has been successfully applied to the Honeyoey Creek-Pine Creek watershed in Michigan, USA to evaluate various BMP scenarios and determine the best solution for both the stakeholders and the overall stream health. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Introduction: All governments, regardless of available resources, should move to establish a balance between the conflict of resource scarcity of health system and health care services required. This study applied a multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach to contribute to priority-setting and the coverage decision-making on including uninsured orthopedics interventions in the healthcare transformation plan’s subsidized in Iran during year 2015. Methods: This study was conducted in four phases: a comprehensive review of studies related to the methods and criteria for prioritizing health services, identifying prioritization criteria, scoring and finalizing them, weighting of the criteria identified, and planning for a prioritized uninsured coverage for orthopedics intervention. Results: After screening the retrieved titles via PRISMA, from 350 papers, 12 studies were included. The main criteria used for the priority step in the health sector were as follows: safety, efficacy, need, existence of alternative procedures, life expectancy impact, cost, cost-effectiveness, catastrophic health expenditure, impact on the budget, acceptance of social/economic and equity in access. According to the viewpoint of the experts, the safety criteria had maximum weight (0.4) and equity in access had the least weight (0.03). Finally, ten uninsured orthopedics services were prioritized with a score of 9.01 to 5.01. Conclusions: This practical and real-life project significantly contributed to rational, apparent, and unbiased priority-setting practice by using the MCDA methodology. Prioritizing and weighting the criteria in this study indicated that the Iranian policymakers should pay more attention to clinical aspects and benefits of the service than financial issues. This could indicate that there are social perspective and health as the public right in the country. © 2016, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.},

abstract={The article concentrates on the problem of quality of institutions in the European Union countries in the context of their compatibility with the global knowledge-based economy. The main objective of the article is to evaluate the progress obtained in that field by New Member States of the European Union in the years 2000-2013. The empirical research is based on the following hypothesis: the integration process of Central European countries with the European Union has influenced the acceleration of changes leading to improvement in the quality of their institutional systems in the context of global knowledge-based economy. The first part of the paper presents the most important determinants of the ability of a country to utilize the potential of the knowledge-based economy. This analysis is conducted on the basis of institutional economics specifically transaction cost theory. In the empirical part multiple criteria decision analysis methodology (MCDA) (the modified TOPSIS method) is applied. Data from Fraser Institute data base for Economic Freedom of the World Report has been used. The empirical research is the source of significant arguments in favor of the hypothesis of the paper. © 2016, Centre of Sociological Research. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Many decision processes in technical and economical sciences or in strategic planning require multiple criteria decision making. The most widely applied methods for multiple criteria evaluation of alternatives are based on evaluating alternatives in terms of an additive preference function. All of them require the estimation of weights of the multiple and conflicting criteria. There are several sophisticated methods how to find the weights of the criteria and how to find the evaluation of each alternative in each criterion. The decision process itself is based on simple weighted sum of these values. However, this may not be the best approach in all situations. This paper contains a new approach to the evaluation of measured value set by different mathematical operators than the usually used multiple criteria evaluation methods. The proposed method is much more profitable especially in situations when the maximum agreement value among expert evaluation is to be found. The approach was applied in a case study for multiple criteria evaluation of road junction. The technique can be used for choosing the appropriate road junction type from the point of view of technical, economical and ecological impacts of the construction. Generally, this new decision-support tool can help in various situations where different types of effects caused by a construction occur.},

abstract={In the last few years multiple-criteria decision analysis methods (MCDA) have received more and more attention from researchers. Consequently, the new methods have made it possible to solve a lot of real-world decision problems in the areas of private lives, management practice or science. However, proper selection of a MCDA method reflecting a decision problem and a decision-maker’s preferences is a complex and important issue and inappropriate selection of a MCDA method may lead to generating improper recommendation. Therefore, this paper suggests using an ontology as a tool supporting multiple-criteria decision analysis method selection. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Supplier evaluation and selection is recognized as a multiple criteria problem. Having considerable economic impact and influencing a competitive position of a buyer, supplier selection has been modelled by different multiple criteria decision analysis approaches. This case study focuses on the reported “relevance gap” between theoretical approaches to the supplier selection problem and practice. The research was conducted in a textile group, addressing a typical buying situation of a main raw material. The decision process was structured with weighted score, AHP and goal programming models. Three models elaborated have led to the very similar output, recognized as realistic and consistent by the decision makers. Acquired skills of multiple criteria decision analysis were considered as beneficial for supplier selection decisions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={We provide an updated overview of the state of multiple criteria decision support software. Many methods and approaches have been proposed in the literature to handle multiple criteria decision analysis, and there is an abundance of software that implements or supports many of these approaches. Our review is structured around several decision considerations when searching for appropriate available software. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.},

Both MOIRA DSS [] and MOIRA-PLUS [] are designed to help DMs to select countermeasure strategies for different kinds of aquatic ecosystems and contamination scenarios. Both systems include an evaluation module based on an additive multi-attribute value model to assess different alternatives. The utility assessment methods, probability equivalent method (PE) and certainty equivalent method (CE) [], are implemented jointly to assess component value functions. The evaluation module also provides multi-parametric sensitivity analyses with respect to both weights and value. MOIRA-PLUS includes some functionality improvements based on the testing and assessment of MOIRA in various project. The improvements include prediction for the migration of heavy metals and improved software interfaces. Both versions are windows-based.},

abstract={Sustainable development is a multidimensional concept, including socioeconomic, ecological, technical and ethical perspectives. In making sustainability policies operational, basic questions to be answered are sustainability of what and whom? As a consequence, sustainability issues are characterised by a high degree of conflict. The main objective of this chapter is to show that multiple-criteria decision analysis is an adequate approach for dealing with sustainability conflicts at both micro and macro levels of analysis. To achieve this objective, lessons, learned from both theoretical arguments and empirical experience, are reviewed. Guidelines of “good practice” are suggested too. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.},

abstract={Health care decisions are complex and involve confronting trade-offs between multiple, often conflicting, objectives. Using structured, explicit approaches to decisions involving multiple criteria can improve the quality of decision making and a set of techniques, known under the collective heading multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), are useful for this purpose. MCDA methods are widely used in other sectors, and recently there has been an increase in health care applications. In 2014, ISPOR established an MCDA Emerging Good Practices Task Force. It was charged with establishing a common definition for MCDA in health care decision making and developing good practice guidelines for conducting MCDA to aid health care decision making. This initial ISPOR MCDA task force report provides an introduction to MCDA - it defines MCDA; provides examples of its use in different kinds of decision making in health care (including benefit risk analysis, health technology assessment, resource allocation, portfolio decision analysis, shared patient clinician decision making and prioritizing patients' access to services); provides an overview of the principal methods of MCDA; and describes the key steps involved. Upon reviewing this report, readers should have a solid overview of MCDA methods and their potential for supporting health care decision making. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).},

abstract={This paper deals with site selection problems for wind power plants and aims to propose a structural procedure for determining the most feasible sites. The application area is Western Turkey. The methodology is mainly composed of two stages: the first stage is pre-elimination of infeasible sites, and the second stage is evaluation of the available ones. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used to generate layers of data and to apply the elimination criteria and constraints. The alternative land areas are handled in terms of identical-sized grids, which are large enough to install one wind turbine each. Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is then used to rank and sort the grids via the identified evaluation criteria. The problem is evaluated in 13 fields, which are a collection of several grids in order to evaluate larger scale areas to construct wind farms rather than for individual turbines. The evaluations are made both at grid (micro) and field (macro) levels and both deterministic and uncertain data are used. The results reveal a high level of consensus on the most feasible sites between the different MCDA methods applied. The proposed methodology provides a structured decision aid, which can be applied to other energy site selection problems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to develop useful likelihood-based assignment methods for addressing multiple criteria decision-making problems within the environment of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Based on the likelihoods of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations, this paper determines the mean likelihoods of outranking relations and presents a mean likelihood determination method for generating a set of criterion-wise rankings of alternatives. By employing the concepts of rank frequency matrices and (ordinary) rank contribution matrices, this paper establishes a likelihood-based linear assignment model for multiple criteria decision analysis in the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy context. Additionally, this paper propounds two likelihood-based assignment models for handling incomplete and conflicting certain information of importance weights. These models can transform the criterion-wise ranks into the overall ranks for determining the optimal priority ranking of the alternatives. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods are illustrated with a practical problem of selecting a bridge construction method which involves various preference types. Finally, this paper conducts a comparative analysis with previous assignment-based methods in an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy setting to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed methods. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Decision makers in different health care settings need to weigh the benefits and harms of alternative treatment strategies. Such health care decisions include marketing authorization by regulatory agencies, practice guideline formulation by clinical groups, and treatment selection by prescribers and patients in clinical practice. Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a family of formal methods that help make explicit the tradeoffs that decision makers accept between the benefit and risk outcomes of different treatment options. Despite the recent interest in MCDA, certain methodological aspects are poorly understood. This paper presents 7 guidelines for applying MCDA in benefit-risk assessment and illustrates their use in the selection of a statin drug for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. We provide guidance on the key methodological issues of how to define the decision problem, how to select a set of nonoverlapping evaluation criteria, how to synthesize and summarize the evidence, how to translate relative measures to absolute ones that permit comparisons between the criteria, how to define suitable scale ranges, how to elicit partial preference information from the decision makers, and how to incorporate uncertainty in the analysis. Our example on statins indicates that fluvastatin is likely to be the most preferred drug by our decision maker and that this result is insensitive to the amount of preference information incorporated in the analysis. © Society for Medical Decision Making.},

abstract={The real estate sector has been negatively affected by the recent economic recession, which has forced structural changes that impact property value and price. Recent pressures have also motivated reduced liquidity and access to credit, causing a drop in property sales and, thus, boosting the rental housing market. It is worth noting, however, that the rental housing segment is not with-out difficulties and complexity, namely in terms of legislation and rental value revaluation. In light of this reasoning, this study aims to develop a multiple criteria decision support system for calculation of residential rents. By integrating cognitive maps and the measuring attractiveness by a categorical based evaluation technique (MACBETH), we also aim to introduce simplicity and transparency in the decision making framework. The practical implications, advantages and shortfalls of our proposal are also analyzed. © 2015 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.},

abstract={Integration of corporate social responsibility (CSR) into a company's mainstream strategy is a complex task. Practical implementation of CSR requires analysis of both the external and internal environments to determine the prospects and challenges significantly influencing integration of sustainability into business strategy. In order to overcome limitations of single multiple-criteria decision analysis models, this paper proposes a hybrid integrated framework combining cognitive mapping and analytic networks process (ANP) to determine, prioritise and select CSR programmes for implementation. The strategic cognitive map serves as a foundation to build the ANP network and identify the importance of CSR programmes. A knapsack optimisation method is then used to optimally assign resources to CSR alternatives. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework through a case study in the extractive sector. The framework was empirically tested with 61 respondents using postal and online surveys, MBA workshops, and conference networking. © 2015 Operational Research Society Ltd.},

abstract={Mining association rules is a leading task, which attracted the attention of researchers, it is one of the technical potential of data mining that allows discovered correlations and association between voluminous datasets. It generally spend two important steps, in the first is the extraction of frequent items, and extracting association rules from this frequent items for the second step. This extraction is a difficult task, costly in terms of response time and memory space as the number of frequent items is exponential to the number of items in database. Many algorithms have been designed to answer these problems. Nevertheless, the high number of algorithms is itself an obstacle to the ability of choice of an expert. In this context we propose an approach to make a good choice of extraction algorithm based on multi-criteria analysis. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to develop a likelihood-based QUALIFLEX method with interval type-2 fuzzy sets for multiple criteria decision analysis. This paper considers the context of interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers and also introduces an extended concept of likelihoods of interval type-2 fuzzy preference relations. The concepts of lower and upper likelihoods are presented to serve as lower and upper bounds, respectively, of the possibility of preference relations and then to determine the likelihoods between interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. This paper uses a likelihood-based comparison between evaluative ratings to propose the concepts of concordance indices and comprehensive concordance indices for evaluating the permutations of alternatives corresponding to criterion-by-criterion consistency. By employing the signed distance-based method or the optimal membership-degree-determination method, the best permutation and its corresponding optimal ranking order of the alternatives can be acquired through a comparison of all of the comprehensive concordance indices. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method are illustrated with a medical decision-making problem that addresses the selection of treatment options. Additionally, a comparative analysis is performed with some relevant multiple criteria decision-making methods to demonstrate the advantages of the likelihood-based QUALIFLEX method. Finally, an analysis through computational experiments is conducted to examine the implementation efficiency of the proposed method. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Abstract The aim of this paper is to develop a simulated annealing-based permutation method for multiple criteria decision analysis within the environment of interval type-2 fuzzy sets. The outranking methodology constitutes one of the most fruitful approaches in multiple criteria decision making and has been applied in numerous real-world problems. The permutation method is a classical outranking model, which generalizes Jacquet-Lagreze's permutation method and is based on a pairwise criterion comparison of the alternatives. Because modeling of the uncertainty in the decision-making process becomes increasingly important, an extension to the interval type-2 fuzzy environment is a useful generalization of the permutation method and is appropriate for handling uncertain and imprecise information in practical decision-making situations. This paper produces a signed-distance-based comparison among the comprehensive rankings of alternatives for concordance and discordance analyses. An integrated nonlinear programming model is constructed for estimation of the criterion weights and the optimal ranking order of the alternatives under incomplete preference information. To enhance the implementation efficiency, a simulated annealing-based permutation method and its meta-heuristic algorithm are developed to produce a polynomial time solution for the total completion time problem. Furthermore, computational experiments with notably large amounts of simulation data are conducted to test the solution approach and validate the correctness of the approximate solution compared with the optimal all-permutation-based result. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper attempts to develop an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (IVIF-PROMETHEE) and attempts to apply it to multiple criteria decision analysis. The theory of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets is useful for modeling impressions and quantifying the ambiguous nature of subjective judgments in a convenient manner. PROMETHEE is a well-known and widely used outranking method, but it has not been investigated in depth within the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Based on the concepts of inclusion comparison possibilities, this paper proposes inclusion-based generalized criteria to determine preference functions and global preference indices for acquiring leaving flows, entering flows, and net flows of alternative actions. Using the score functions and accuracy functions of the flows, this paper develops IVIF-PROMETHEE I and IVIF-PROMETHEE II, which are methods for the partial ranking and complete ranking, respectively, of alternatives. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods are illustrated through a problem on the selection of bridge construction methods. Finally, a comparative discussion of other decision-making methods is conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed IVIF-PROMETHEE methods. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={When planning a new development, location decisions have always been a major issue. This paper examines and compares two modelling methods used to inform a healthcare infrastructure location decision. Two Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) models were developed to support the optimisation of this decision-making process, within a National Health Service (NHS) organisation, in the UK. The proposed model structure is based on seven criteria (environment and safety, size, total cost, accessibility, design, risks and population profile) and 28 sub-criteria. First, Evidential Reasoning (ER) was used to solve the model, then, the processes and results were compared with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). It was established that using ER or AHP led to the same solutions. However, the scores between the alternatives were significantly different; which impacted the stakeholders' decision-making. As the processes differ according to the model selected, ER or AHP, it is relevant to establish the practical and managerial implications for selecting one model or the other and providing evidence of which models best fit this specific environment. To achieve an optimum operational decision it is argued, in this study, that the most transparent and robust framework is achieved by merging ER process with the pair-wise comparison, an element of AHP. This paper makes a defined contribution by developing and examining the use of MCDA models, to rationalise new healthcare infrastructure location, with the proposed model to be used for future decision. Moreover, very few studies comparing different MCDA techniques were found, this study results enable practitioners to consider even further the modelling characteristics to ensure the development of a reliable framework, even if this means applying a hybrid approach. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={The underground nuclear power plant can not only make full use of land resources and reduce costs, but also make better use of its passive safety, as well as avoid the radioactivity release into the atmosphere during the serious nuclear accidents taking place, and therefore improve the safety of the nuclear plant. In order to obtain comprehensive and integrated analysis on this new nuclear power plant design, four different underground nuclear power plant designs were introduced in the paper, the feasibility of each design was analyzed, and the multiple criteria decision analysis method was used to choose the best available option after comprehensively evaluating on safety, economic benefit, environmental impact and construction difficulty. Consequently, this new nuclear power plant design was assessed synthetically and comprehensively. © 2015, Atomic Energy Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={Background: This study quantitatively evaluated the comparative efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apizaban) and warfarin for treatment of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. We also compared these agents under different scenarios, including population with high risk of stroke and for primary vs. secondary stroke prevention. Methods: We used multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to assess the benefit-risk of these medications. Our MCDA models contained criteria for benefits (prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism) and risks (intracranial and extracranial bleeding). We calculated a performance score for each drug accounting for benefits and risks in comparison to treatment alternatives. Results: Overall, new agents had higher performance scores than warfarin; in order of performance scores: dabigatran 150 mg (0.529), rivaroxaban (0.462), apixaban (0.426), and warfarin (0.191). For patients at a higher risk of stroke (CHADS2 score≥3), apixaban had the highest performance score (0.686); performance scores for other drugs were 0.462 for dabigatran 150 mg, 0.392 for dabigatran 110 mg, 0.271 for rivaroxaban, and 0.116 for warfarin. Dabigatran 150 mg had the highest performance score for primary stroke prevention, while dabigatran 110 mg had the highest performance score for secondary prevention. Conclusions: Our results suggest that new oral anticoagulants might be preferred over warfarin. Selecting appropriate medicines according to the patient's condition based on information from an integrated benefit-risk assessment of treatment options is crucial to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. © 2015 Hsu et al.},

Three oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is)-sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil-are available for treatment of ED. This study quantitatively evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and safety of these medications to assist treatment decision making. Methods We used multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to assess the totality of risk-benefit of PDE5Is. We created two models: (i) the overall model included 'overall improvement in erections' and 'any adverse events' and (ii) the detailed model included 'erectile function domain', 'ability for sexual intercourse', 'duration of erection last', 'serious adverse events', 'headache', 'flushing' and 'dyspepsia'. We calculated a synthetic utility for each drug accounting for all of its benefits and risks. Results Considering the overall risk-benefit, vardenafil had the highest synthetic utility among three medications; in the order of synthetic utilities: vardenafil (0.568), tadalafil (0.478) and sildenafil (0.437). However, when specific risk and benefit criteria were assessed, tadalafil had the highest synthetic utility (0.602) according to the conjoint evaluation (synthetic utility for vardenafil is 0.491 and sildenafil is 0.442, respectively). The sensitivity analysis based on the uncertainties of weight on risks of any adverse events (including serious adverse events and headache) suggested our results were robust. Conclusions This study provides a useful approach that comprehensively and systematically assesses and compares the risk-benefit of several treatment alternatives. Our study not only rank treatment alternatives by synthetic utilities based on the risk-benefit balance but also compare specific risk and benefit criteria between these medicines. Our results provide valuable evidence that can guide clinicians and patients in making treatment decisions. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to develop a linear programming technique for multidimensional analysis of preference (LINMAP) to address multiple criteria decision analysis problems within the interval type-2 fuzzy environment based on interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Considering the issue of anchor dependency, we use multiple anchor points in the decision-making process and employ approximate positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions as the points of reference. Selected useful properties of the approximate ideal solutions are also investigated. In contrast to the classical LINMAP methods, this paper directly generates approximate ideal solutions from the characteristics of all alternatives. Next, this work presents the concept of closeness-based indices using Minkowski distances with approximate ideal solutions to develop a new approach for determining measurements of consistency and inconsistency. Under incomplete preference information on paired comparisons of the alternatives, this paper provides a novel method that uses the concept of comprehensive closeness-based indices to measure the poorness of fit and the goodness of fit. By applying the consistency indices and inconsistency indices, this work formulates an optimization problem that can be solved for the optimal weights of the criteria and thus acquires the best compromise alternative. Additionally, this paper explores the problem of supplier selection and conducts a comparative discussion to validate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed interval type-2 fuzzy LINMAP method with approximate ideal solutions. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to address a marketplace decision difficulty (MPDD)-prone decision-making problem to provide additional contributions for practical implications. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Interval type-2 fuzzy sets are useful and valuable for depicting uncertainty and managing imprecision in decision information. In particular, interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, as a special case of interval type-2 fuzzy sets, can efficiently express qualitative evaluations or assessments. In this work, the concept of the likelihoods of interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy preference relations based on lower and upper likelihoods is investigated, and the relevant properties are discussed. This paper focuses on the use of likelihoods in addressing multiple criteria decision analysis problems in which the evaluative ratings of the alternatives and the importance weights of the criteria are expressed as interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. A new likelihood-based decision-making method is developed using the useful concepts of likelihood-based performance indices, likelihood-based comprehensive evaluation values, and signed distance-based evaluation values. A simplified version of the proposed method is also provided to adapt the decision-making context in which the importance weights of the criteria take the form of ordinary numbers. The practical effectiveness of the proposed method is validated with four applications, and several comparative analyses are conducted to verify the advantages of the proposed method over other multiple criteria decision-making methods. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={QUALIFLEX (QUALItative FLEXible multiple criteria method) is a very useful outranking method to deal simultaneously with the cardinal and ordinal information in decision making process. The purpose of this paper is to develop a hesitant fuzzy QUALIFLEX with a signed distance-based comparison method for handling multi-criteria decision-making problems in which both the assessments of alternatives on criteria and the weights of criteria are expressed by hesitant fuzzy elements (HFEs). We propose a novel concept of hesitancy index for the HFE to measure the degree of hesitancy of the decision-maker or the decision organization. By taking their hesitancy indices into account, we present a signed distance-based method to compare the magnitude of HFEs. Using the signed distance-based comparison approach, we define the concordance/discordance index, the weighted concordance/discordance index and the comprehensive concordance/discordance index. By investigating all possible permutations of alternatives with respect to the level of concordance/discordance of the complete preference order, the optimal ranking orders of alternatives can be obtained. An application study of the proposed method on green supplier selection is conducted. The study indicates that the proposed method does not require the complicated computation procedures but still yields a reasonable and credible solution. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The development of a cardiovascular diseases classifier (CDC) for auto-diagnosis will help address solve the problem. Former CDCs did not achieve quick evaluation of cardiovascular diseases. In this letter, a new CDC to achieve speedy detection is investigated. This investigation incorporates the analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-based multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to develop feature vectors using a Support Vector Machine. The MCDA facilitates the efficient assignment of appropriate weightings to potential patients, thus scaling down the number of features. Since the new CDC will only adopt the most meaningful features for discrimination between healthy persons versus cardiovascular disease patients, a speedy detection of cardiovascular diseases has been successfully implemented. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Blended learning has proved to be more effective than either online learning or face-To-face instruction. For many researchers in higher education, it is almost certain that blended learning will be the new traditional model for course delivery. Despite this, designing blended learning courses is still a major challenge for many academics. Educational institutions' lack of access to blended learning technical and pedagogical support, the large numbers of blended learning components that need to be considered when constructing a blended learning experience and the lack of a universally recognized formula or defined standards to guide the design process are examples of major challenges facing academics who want to implement a successful blended learning experience. To facilitate the design process, this paper discusses the different design challenges that face academics when designing their blended learning courses. It then discusses the applicability of using a multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach to address these challenges and facilitate the design.},

abstract={Abstract The technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions (TOPSIS) is a well-known compromising method for addressing decision-making problems. In general, incomplete preference information and vague subjective judgments are realistic in practice. Accordingly, the theory of interval type-2 fuzzy sets has received increasing attention in the decision-making field because of its great ability to handle imprecise and ambiguous information in a convenient manner. The purpose of this paper is to develop a novel interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS method for multiple criteria decision analysis that is based on interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. This paper introduces the concept of approximate positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions and presents a simple way to approach the evaluative ratings of ideal solutions using interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Based on the likelihoods of interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy binary relations, this paper proposes certain likelihood-based comparison indices to establish a likelihood-based closeness coefficient of each alternative relative to the approximate ideals. Applying a likelihood-based comparison approach with the approximate ideals, this paper develops the interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS procedure to determine the priority ranking orders of the alternatives under consideration of the multiple criteria evaluation/selection. Three practical applications involving landfill site selection, supplier selection, and car evaluation are examined to show the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method. Furthermore, this paper makes a comparison of the solution results yielded by other interval type-2 fuzzy decision-making methods. The comparative analyses demonstrate that the proposed interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS method is easy to implement and produces effective and valid results for solving multiple criteria decision-making problems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In our previous work published in this journal, we showed how the Hit-And-Run (HAR) procedure enables efficient sampling of criteria weights from a space formed by restricting a simplex with arbitrary linear inequality constraints. In this short communication, we note that the method for generating a basis of the sampling space can be generalized to also handle arbitrary linear equality constraints. This enables the application of HAR to sampling spaces that do not coincide with the simplex, thereby allowing the combined use of imprecise and precise preference statements. In addition, it has come to our attention that one of the methods we proposed for generating a starting point for the Markov chain was flawed. To correct this, we provide an alternative method that is guaranteed to produce a starting point that lies within the interior of the sampling space. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to develop a likelihood-based outranking method for handling multiple criteria decision analysis problems based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Using the concept of likelihood of the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations, this paper determines certain generalized criteria and the corresponding likelihood-based preference functions. Based on some useful concepts of comprehensive preference indices, concordance indices, counter-likelihood-based preference functions, and discordance indices, this paper conducts a concordance-discordance analysis with concordance and discordance outranking relationships to determine a global Boolean matrix and acquire partial ranking orders of the alternatives. Alternatively, this paper determines complete ranking orders of the alternatives using the concepts of net concordance indices, net discordance indices, and mean outranking values. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed method are illustrated with a practical multiple criteria decision-making application concerning the selection of a suitable bridge construction method. Finally, comparative discussions with different decision-making methods are conducted to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method in aiding decision making. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to develop an inclusion-based LINMAP (i.e., Linear Programming Technique for Multidimensional Analysis of Preference) method for multiple criteria decision analysis that is based on interval-valued Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Using the inclusion comparison possibility in the interval-valued Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy context, an inclusion-based index of interval-valued Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy numbers is proposed that considers positive and negative ideals. An inclusion-based consistency index and an inclusion-based inconsistency index to measure the concordance and discordance, respectively, between paired comparison judgments are suggested. An inclusion-based LINMAP model is constructed using a linear programming technique to determine the optimal criterion weights and obtain the corresponding comprehensive inclusion-based index for each alternative. Then, the priority order of the alternatives can be acquired according to the comprehensive inclusion-based indices. The feasibility of the proposed method is illustrated using a practical problem that relates to the selection of bridge construction methods. A comparative analysis of other relevant decision-making methods is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the developed methodology. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Air transportation systems are complex, interdisciplinary integrated systems, because there are large numbers of components with different characteristics. It is challenging to assess new technology in complex, interdisciplinary integrated systems, such as air transportation systems. The focus of this research is one element in complex air transportation systems: aircraft. The success of an aircraft is no longer dominated by economic criteria. Several other criteria, such as environmental aspects and level of comfort, need to be taken into consideration. Therefore, aircraft design and evaluation are typical multi-criteria decision problems and need to be prudently conducted. One solution is to apply Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) techniques. The goal of this research is to investigate how MCDA techniques can be applied in order to provide better decision aiding for stakeholders in air transportation systems. First, an advanced approach to effectively select the most appropriate decision analysis method for a given decision making problem is formulated and presented in this research. This method selection approach is implemented and an intelligent multi-criteria decision support system is developed. Second, a new approach is proposed for assessing the uncertainties propagated in the decision analysis process. The uncertainty assessment approach consists of four steps: uncertainty characterization, uncertainty analysis, local sensitivity analysis, and global sensitivity analysis. This novel approach for uncertainty assessment can be used to aggregate input data from tools with different fidelity levels and is capable of propagating uncertainties in an assessment chain. Third, two proofs of concept are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of applying the most appropriate MCDA techniques in aircraft design and evaluation processes. In order to efficiently assess the uncertainties related to the subjective preference information in aircraft design process, surrogate models for design criteria in terms of weighting factors are developed. Furthermore, soft criteria quantification in aircraft evaluation process permits the synergy of hard technical criteria and additional soft criteria for the MCDA techniques.},

abstract={This paper deals with a real-world decision-aiding problem for zoning the risk of erosion, total suspended solids emissions, and ecological consequences of their transfers towards the streams. One of these consequences is the decrease of fishes into the streams in agricultural watersheds, because of the clogging of spawning areas. Given the multiple criteria nature of the problem, the originality of our research is to adapt a new decision-aiding sorting method, ELECTRE TRI-C, for identifying risk zones in rural areas, where measures must be taken. The developed model was applied in a small watershed (Low Normandy, France) where the objective was to assess the most appropriate intervention for protecting the reproduction habitat of the salmonid fishes. Agricultural parcels were evaluated on multiple criteria for grouping them into four risk categories, which are related to risk levels as well as priorities on the improvement works. The decision-aiding sorting model is co-constructed, within a constructive approach, through an interaction process between decision-aiding analysts, environmental experts, and local actors for improving transparency and communication on the results. This model is linked with a geographical information system (GIS) for assessing a set of criteria and the visualization of the farming parcels along with their type of intervention they should be submitted to best practices. The assignment results were validated by the environmental experts. These results have a strong impact on the agricultural practices of the farmers into the watersheds. The model proposed in this paper can be considered as a useful decision aid tool in any regions for implementing public agricultural and environmental policies for protecting the ecological areas. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={QUALIFLEX (i.e., QUALItative FLEXible multiple criteria method) is a useful outranking method used for multiple criteria decision analysis. This paper uses the main structure of QUALIFLEX to develop an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy QUALIFLEX outranking method with a likelihood-based comparison approach for handling multiple criteria decision-making problems within a decision environment of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. We propose the concept of using the likelihood of fuzzy preference relations to compare interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. To address diversiform preference types, we represent the decision-maker's various forms of preference structures and assess the criterion weights using incomplete information. Using a criterion-wise preference of alternatives via comparison of the likelihoods, we develop a new QUALIFLEX-based model to measure the level of concordance of the complete preference order for managing multiple criteria decisions. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods are illustrated using a practical example, namely, the selection of a suitable bridge construction method. A comparative analysis with other relevant methods is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background The Problem formulation, Objectives, Alternatives, Consequences, Trade-offs, Uncertainties, Risk attitude, and Linked decisions (PrOACT-URL) framework and multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) have been recommended by the European Medicines Agency for structured benefit-risk assessment of medicinal products undergoing regulatory review. Objective The objective of this article was to provide solutions to incorporate the uncertainty from clinical data into the MCDA model when evaluating the overall benefit-risk profiles among different treatment options. Methods Two statistical approaches, the δ-method approach and the Monte-Carlo approach, were proposed to construct the confidence interval of the overall benefit-risk score from the MCDA model as well as other probabilistic measures for comparing the benefit-risk profiles between treatment options. Both approaches can incorporate the correlation structure between clinical parameters (criteria) in the MCDA model and are straightforward to implement. Results The two proposed approaches were applied to a case study to evaluate the benefit-risk profile of an add-on therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (drug X) relative to placebo. It demonstrated a straightforward way to quantify the impact of the uncertainty from clinical data to the benefit-risk assessment and enabled statistical inference on evaluating the overall benefit-risk profiles among different treatment options. Conclusions The δ-method approach provides a closed form to quantify the variability of the overall benefit-risk score in the MCDA model, whereas the Monte-Carlo approach is more computationally intensive but can yield its true sampling distribution for statistical inference. The obtained confidence intervals and other probabilistic measures from the two approaches enhance the benefit-risk decision making of medicinal products. © 2014 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).},

abstract={With the gaining popularity of multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) among researchers and practitioners, a variety of software that implements sophisticated MCDA methods and techniques is now available. To address the issue of the missing methodological approach in MCDA software selection, especially the mismatch between the decision making situation (DMS) structuring and the preference structuring employed by the tools, we propose a framework to enable the decision maker to choose relevant MCDA software. This is the first attempt to formally model the MCDA software selection process. A comprehensive set of MCDA methods meta-data for software selection is identified and demonstrated using the example of a specific DMS. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Various software tools implementing multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods have appeared over the last decades. Although MCDA methods share common features, most of the implementing software have been developed independently from scratch. Majority of the tools have a proprietary storage format and exchanging data among software is cumbersome. Common data exchange standard would be useful for an analyst wanting to apply different methods on the same problem. The Decision Deck project has proposed to build components implementing MCDA methods in a reusable and interchangeable manner. A key element in this scheme is the XMCDA standard, a proposal that aims to standardize an XML encoding of common structures appearing in MCDA models, such as criteria and performance evaluations. Although XMCDA allows to present most data structures for MCDA models, it almost completely lacks data integrity checks. In this paper we present a new comprehensive data model for MCDA problems, implemented as an XML schema. The data model includes types that are sufficient to represent multi-attribute value/utility models, ELECTRE III/TRI models, and their stochastic extensions, and AHP. We also discuss use of the data model in algorithmic MCDA. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This paper develops new methods based on the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE) that use a signed distance-based approach within the environment of interval type-2 fuzzy sets for multiple criteria decision analysis. The theory of interval type-2 fuzzy sets provides an intuitive and computationally feasible way of addressing uncertain and ambiguous information in decision-making fields. Many studies have developed multiple criteria decision analysis methods in the context of interval type-2 fuzzy sets; most of these methods can be characterized as scoring or compromising models. Nevertheless, the extended versions of outranking methods have not been thoroughly investigated. This paper establishes interval type-2 fuzzy PROMETHEE methods for ranking alternative actions among multiple criteria based on the concepts of signed distance-based generalized criteria and comprehensive preference indices. We develop interval type-2 fuzzy PROMETHEE I and interval type-2 fuzzy PROMETHEE II procedures for partial and complete ranking, respectively, of the alternatives. Finally, the feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods are illustrated by a practical problem of landfill site selection. A comparative analysis is also performed with ordinary fuzzy PROMETHEE methods to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The theory of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets is useful and beneficial for handling uncertainty and imprecision in multiple criteria decision analysis. In addition, the theory allows for convenient quantification of the equivocal nature of human subjective assessments. In this paper, by extending the traditional linear assignment method, we propose a useful method for solving multiple criteria evaluation problems in the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy context. A ranking procedure consisting of score functions, accuracy functions, membership uncertainty indices, and hesitation uncertainty indices is presented to determine a criterion-wise preference of the alternatives. An extended linear assignment model is then constructed using a modified weighted-rank frequency matrix to determine the priority order of various alternatives. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed method are illustrated with a multiple criteria decision-making problem involving the selection of a bridge construction method. Additionally, a comparative analysis with other methods, including the approach with weighted aggregation operators, the closeness coefficient-based method, and the auxiliary nonlinear programming models, has been conducted for solving the investment company selection problem to validate the effectiveness of the extended linear assignment method. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The potential of Cloud services for cost reduction and other benefits has been capturing the attention of organizations. However, a difficult decision arises when an IT manager has to select a Cloud services provider because there are no established guidelines to help make that decision. In order to address this problem, we propose a multi-criteria model to evaluate Cloud services using the MACBETH method. The proposed method was demonstrated in a City Council in Portugal to evaluate and compare two Cloud services: Google Apps and Microsoft Office 365. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Claimed by the Harvard Business Review as one of the main innovations of recent decades in management systems, the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) has been widely studied and applied in different management contexts. However, despite recent progress and its undeniable merit, the BSC has its own shortcomings. As reported in the literature, it seems generally agreed that the way compensations between criteria within a BSC framework are calculated remains an open issue. Thus, one of the contributions of this study is to augment the theoretical discussion on the potentialities of the multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach to bring simplicity and transparency to the calculation of compensations (i.e. trade-offs) among evaluation criteria within a BSC framework. It seems important to underline that this paper builds on previous work and is not empirical research. However, it aims to extend the discussion to other (new) measurement contexts. We believe that the development and promotion of the integrated use of MCDA tools in BSC applications to measure trade-offs among evaluation criteria in the BSC framework can be a key factor in ensuring more successful implementations and uses of the BSC within firms. © 2013 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.},

abstract={QUALIFLEX, a generalization of Jacquet-Lagreze's permutation method, is a useful outranking method in decision analysis because of its flexibility with respect to cardinal and ordinal information. This paper develops an extended QUALIFLEX method for handling multiple criteria decision-making problems in the context of interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Interval type-2 fuzzy sets contain membership values that are crisp intervals, which are the most widely used of the higher order fuzzy sets because of their relative simplicity. Using the linguistic rating system converted into interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, the extended QUALIFLEX method investigates all possible permutations of the alternatives with respect to the level of concordance of the complete preference order. Based on a signed distance-based approach, this paper proposes the concordance/discordance index, the weighted concordance/discordance index, and the comprehensive concordance/discordance index as evaluative criteria of the chosen hypothesis for ranking the alternatives. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods are illustrated by a medical decision-making problem concerning acute inflammatory demyelinating disease, and a comparative analysis with another outranking approach is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={This paper analyses and presents the new scientific models and methods for the expert evaluation of quality of learning objects (LOs) paying special attention to LOs reusability level. Currently all existing approaches in the area are quite subjective and depend only on the experience of the decision-makers. The authors analyse several scientific methods and principles to minimise the subjectivity level in the expert evaluation of LOs quality. They are: (a) the principles of multi-criteria decision analysis for identification of quality criteria, (b) technological quality criteria classification principle, (c) fuzzy group decision making theory to obtain evaluation measures, (d) normalisation of the weights of criteria, and (e) scalarisation method for LOs quality optimisation. The authors demonstrate that the complex application of these approaches could significantly improve the quality of the expert evaluation of LOs and noticeably reduce the level of the expert evaluation subjectivity. The paper also presents the example of practical application of these approaches for evaluation of LOs for Mathematics subject. © 2013, IGI Global.},

abstract={Models for Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) often separate per-criterion attractiveness evaluation from weighted aggregation of these evaluations across the different criteria. In simulation-based MCDA methods, such as Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis, uncertainty in the weights is modeled through a uniform distribution on the feasible weight space defined by a set of linear constraints. Efficient sampling methods have been proposed for special cases, such as the unconstrained weight space or complete ordering of the weights. However, no efficient methods are available for other constraints such as imprecise trade-off ratios, and specialized sampling methods do not allow for flexibility in combining the different constraint types. In this paper, we explore how the Hit-And-Run sampler can be applied as a general approach for sampling from the convex weight space that results from an arbitrary combination of linear weight constraints. We present a technique for transforming the weight space to enable application of Hit-And-Run, and evaluate the sampler's efficiency through computational tests. Our results show that the thinning factor required to obtain uniform samples can be expressed as a function of the number of criteria n as (n) = (n - 1) 3. We also find that the technique is reasonably fast with problem sizes encountered in practice and that autocorrelation is an appropriate convergence metric. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The theory of interval type-2 fuzzy sets is valuable for modeling impressions in multiple-criteria decision analysis problems. Based on signed distances, we develop a new linear assignment method to produce an optimal preference ranking of the alternatives in accordance with a set of criterion-wise rankings and a set of criterion importance within the context of interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Applying the proposed method to a case involving the selection of a landfill site, we demonstrate that the proposed method is easy to employ and that it produces actionable results that aid the decision-making process. The proposed interval type-2 fuzzy linear assignment method utilizes signed distances, does not require a complicated computation procedure and will be beneficial to decision analysis. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Scoring rules are an important disputable subject in data envelopment analysis (DEA). Various organizations use voting systems whose main object is to rank alternatives. In these methods, the ranks of alternatives are obtained by their associated weights. The method for determining the ranks of alternatives by their weights is an important issue. This problem has been the subject at hand of some authors. We suggest a three-stage method for the ranking of alternatives. In the first stage, the rank position of each alternative is computed based on the best and worst weights in the optimistic and pessimistic cases, respectively. The vector of weights obtained in the first stage is not a singleton. Hence, to deal with this problem, a secondary goal is used in the second stage. In the third stage of our method, the ranks of the alternatives approach the optimistic or pessimistic case. It is mentionable that the model proposed in the third stage is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model and there are several methods for solving it; we use the weighted sum method in this paper. The model is solved by mixed integer programming. Also, we obtain an interval for the rank of each alternative. We present two models on the basis of the average of ranks in the optimistic and pessimistic cases. The aim of these models is to compute the rank by common weights. © 2012.},

abstract={This article describes the development of a decision support tool based on multicriteria analysis, which uses the results of a risk analysis to evaluate and compare risk reduction measures. The literature contains a wide range of risk analysis techniques and we used the combined risk analysis method that is often used in water distribution systems. The multicritera decision analysis employed considers five of the methods most often applied to water resources problems: weighted sum, TOPSIS, ELECTRE I and III, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). A method was developed that integrates the risk and multicriteria decision analysis applicable to a water distribution network. The main steps of this approach are: first, to identify the pipes that are expected to be more constraining, i.e. pipes with a relatively high probability of failing and/or producing an extreme effect in the event of failure; second, to consider measures which could reduce the likelihood and/or consequences of the occurrence of these events; third, to analyse these measures through multicriteria decision analysis to identify the most effective technical and economic solution.

abstract={Objectives: Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been suggested by some researchers as a method to capture the benefits beyond quality adjusted life-years in a transparent and consistent manner. The objectives of this article were to analyze the possible application of MCDA approaches in health technology assessment and to describe their relative advantages and disadvantages. Methods: This article begins with an introduction to the most common types of MCDA models and a critical review of state-of-the-art methods for incorporating multiple criteria in health technology assessment. An overview of MCDA is provided and is compared against the current UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence health technology appraisal process. A generic MCDA modeling approach is described, and the different MCDA modeling approaches are applied to a hypothetical case study. Results: A comparison of the different MCDA approaches is provided, and the generic issues that need consideration before the application of MCDA in health technology assessment are examined. Conclusions: There are general practical issues that might arise from using an MCDA approach, and it is suggested that appropriate care be taken to ensure the success of MCDA techniques in the appraisal process. © 2012 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

abstract={Multiple criteria decision analysis plays an important role in many real life problems found in business, economics, management, governmental and political disputes. The game-theoretic rough set model (GTRS) is a recent extension to rough set theory for intelligent decision making observed with game-theoretic formulation. In this article, we extend GTRS for formulating and analyzing multiple criteria decision making problems in rough sets. Basic concepts of the model are defined, reviewed and analyzed in the context of multiple criteria. Applicability of GTRS is demonstrated by considering different examples, including multiple criteria effective classification, rule mining and feature selection. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={This research work focuses on the definition of the factors that determine the selection of residence site in urban and rural areas in Greece. The followed approach is based on an analysis that takes into account the nature and the peculiarities of the problem studied and it is built around a multiple-criteria methodology with reference to objective and subjective criteria, which constitute the quantitative and qualitative parameters of the system, respectively. The evaluation of the importance of each parameter separately, of each group of criteria and the total number of criteria (objective and subjective) for each area is attempted to define the final result (preference measure or priority) for the selection of residence site in urban and rural environments in Greece. Research findings provide indications that can lead to important conclusions and contribute to the development of policy proposals not only in Greece but also at international level with regard to the issues of: selection of location and residence, regional development, decentralisation as well as the study of the non-homogeneous and in-balanced development of urban and rural areas. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The theory of interval valued fuzzy sets is very valuable for modeling impressions of decision makers. In addition, it gives ability to quantify the ambiguous nature of subjective judgments in an easy way. In this paper, by extending the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), it is proposed a useful method based on generalized interval valued trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (GITrFNs) for solving multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problems. In view of complexity in handling sophisticated data of GITrFNs, this paper employs the concept of signed distances to establish a simple and effective MCDA method based on the main structure of TOPSIS. An algorithm based on TOPSIS method is established to determine the priority order of given alternatives by using properties of signed distances.

abstract={The frequently used methods of handling optimism and pessimism in multiple criteria decision analysis are Hurwicz's and Yager's approaches. Despite their wide usage, a critical issue has been raised about unidimensionality. Numerous psychological researches and empirical findings have convincingly supported that optimism and pessimism do not represent opposite poles on a single, bipolar dimension, but they are conceived as two partially independent dimensions instead. The focus of this paper is a two-dimensional approach by adequately employing the degrees of membership and non-membership based on Atanassov fuzzy sets. This study develops optimistic and pessimistic estimations with several fuzzy point operators to draw the influences of optimism and pessimism on multicriteria decision making for the sake of a better fit than the unidimensional model. Given a typology from empirical grounds, the appropriate point operators specific to each type are suggested to identify adaptational outcomes. Base upon a series of new score functions, a useful method for multiple criteria decision analysis is provided to efficiently facilitate decision analysis with a multimeasure approach. Feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods are illustrated by a practical example. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The combination of multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and participatory planning is an approach that has been applied in complex planning situations where multiple criteria of very different natures are considered, and several stakeholders or social groups are involved. The spatial character of forest planning problems adds further to the complexity, because a large number of forest stands are to be assigned different treatments at different points in time. In addition, experience from participatory forest planning indicates that stakeholders may think about the forest in terms of place-specific values rather than in forest-wide ters. The objective of this study was to present an approach for including place-specific values in MCDA-based participatory forest planning and illustrate the approach by a case study where the objective was to choose a multipurpose forest plan for an area of urban forest in northern Sweden. Stakeholder values were identified in interviews, and maps were used to capture place-specific spatial values. The nonspatial and nonplace-specific spatial values were formulated as criteria and used to build an objective hierarchy describing the decision situation. The place-specific spatial values were incsluded in the creation of a map showing zones of different silvicultural management classes, which was used as the basis for creation of forest plan alternatives in the subsequent process. The approach seemed to work well for capturing place-specific values, and the study indicates that formalized methods for including and evaluating place-specific values in participatory forest planning processes should be developed and tested further.},

abstract={Important and complex spatial decisions, such as allocating land to development or conservation-oriented goals, require information and tools to aid in understanding the inherent tradeoffs. They also require mechanisms for incorporating and documenting the value judgements of interest groups and decision makers. Multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a family of techniques that aid decision makers in formally structuring multi-faceted decisions and evaluating the alternatives. It has been used for about two decades with geographic information systems (GIS) to analyse spatial problems. However, the variety and complexity of MCDA methods, with their varying terminologies, means that this rich set of tools is not easily accessible to the untrained. This paper provides background for GIS users, analysts and researchers to quickly get up to speed on MCDA, supporting the ultimate goal of making it more accessible to decision makers. A number of factors for describing MCDA problems and selecting methods are outlined then simplified into a decision tree, which organises an introduction of key methods. Approaches range from mathematical programming and heuristic algorithms for simultaneously optimising multiple goals, to more common single-objective techniques based on weighted addition of criteria values, attainment of criteria thresholds, or outranking of alternatives. There is substantial research that demonstrates ways to couple GIS with multi-criteria methods, and to adapt MCDA for use in spatially continuous problems. Increasing the accessibility of GIS-based MCDA provides new opportunities for researchers and practitioners, including web-based participation and advanced visualisation of decision processes. © 2011 The Authors and Crown in the right of Canada.

abstract={Selection of proper phase change material (PCM) plays an important role towards the development of a latent heat thermal energy storage system. Selection of the phase change material is a difficult and restrained task due to the immense number of different available materials having different characteristics. One has to select such PCM which will give the desired thermal performance at minimum cost. This study deals with two Multiple Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) methods to solve PCM selection problem. These two methods are technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method and fuzzy TOPSIS method that uses linguistic variable presentation and fuzzy operation. Both the methods use an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method to determine weights of the criteria. TOPSIS and fuzzy TOPSIS methods are used to obtain final ranking. A problem to evaluate the best choice of PCM used in solar domestic hot water system is considered here to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model. Empirical results showed that the proposed methods are viable approaches in solving PCM selection problem. TOPSIS is suitable for the use of precise performance ratings while the fuzzy TOPSIS is a preferred technique when the performance ratings are vague and inaccurate. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The aim of valuation is to achieve the best estimate of the transaction price of property. The market of specialised properties is very diverse as property does not transact sufficiently often to allow the establishment of price by comparison with previously sold assets. This article describes a multiple criteria decision analysis method that can be used for specialised property valuation. This method is based on a market decision-making principle and is in line with the traditional comparative methods. To estimate the property price, information on as little as two comparable properties is required. The method takes into account a number of different criteria, such as qualitative, quantitative aspects and market conditions. In this article, I describe a theoretical model of the method and provide an example of the estimation of price for a specialised property. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

abstract={Point-source measures have been suggested to decrease pharmaceuticals in water bodies. We analyzed 68 and 50 alternatives, respectively, for a typical Swiss general and psychiatric hospital to decrease pharmaceutical discharge. Technical alternatives included reverse osmosis, ozonation, and activated carbon; organizational alternatives included urine separation. To handle this complex decision, we used Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and combined expert predictions (e.g., costs, pharmaceutical mass flows, ecotoxicological risk, pathogen removal) with subjective preference-valuations from 26 stakeholders (authorities, hospital-internal actors, experts). The general hospital contributed ca. 38% to the total pharmaceutical load at the wastewater treatment plant, the psychiatry contributed 5%. For the general hospital, alternatives removing all pharmaceuticals (especially reverse osmosis, or vacuum-toilets and incineration), performed systematically better than the status quo or urine separation, despite higher costs. They now require closer scrutiny. To remove X-ray contrast agents, introducing roadbags is promising. For the psychiatry with a lower pharmaceutical load, costs were more critical. Stakeholder feedback concerning MCDA was very positive, especially because the results were robust across different stakeholder-types. Our MCDA results provide insight into an important water protection issue: implementing measures to decrease pharmaceuticals will likely meet acceptance. Hospital point-sources merit consideration if the trade-off between costs and pharmaceutical removal is reasonable. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={A hybrid approach integrating OWA (Ordered Weighted Averaging) aggregation into TOPSIS (technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution) is proposed to tackle multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problems. First, the setting of extreme points (ideal and anti-ideal points) in TOPSIS is redefined and extended for handling the multiple extreme points situation where a decision maker (DM) or multiple DMs can provide more than one pair of extreme points. Next, three different aggregation schemes are designed to integrate OWA into the TOPSIS analysis procedure. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the proposed approach and the results are compared for different aggregation settings and confirm the robustness of rankings from different scenarios. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Military and industrial facilities need secure and reliable power generation. Grid outages can result in cascading infrastructure failures as well as security breaches and should be avoided. Adding redundancy and increasing reliability can require additional environmental, financial, logistical, and other considerations and resources. Uncertain scenarios consisting of emergent environmental conditions, regulatory changes, growth of regional energy demands, and other concerns result in further complications. Decisions on selecting energy alternatives are made on an ad hoc basis. The present work integrates scenario analysis and multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to identify combinations of impactful emergent conditions and to perform a preliminary benefits analysis of energy and environmental security investments for industrial and military installations. Application of a traditional MCDA approach would require significant stakeholder elicitations under multiple uncertain scenarios. The approach proposed in this study develops and iteratively adjusts a scoring function for investment alternatives to find the scenarios with the most significant impacts on installation security. A robust prioritization of investment alternatives can be achieved by integrating stakeholder preferences and focusing modeling and decision-analytical tools on a few key emergent conditions and scenarios. The approach is described and demonstrated for a campus of several dozen interconnected industrial buildings within a major installation. © 2010 SETAC.},

abstract={This paper presents the mostrecent evolutionary lines in operational research, through a review of the basic principles that guide this field of research. In broad terms, some emphasis is given to the fact that Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (or Aid) (MCDA) takes into account that decision-making processes are complex and composed of several actors with different perceptions and value systems, stressing that this approach highlights the limits of objectivity, and considers the possibility that some problems may not have an optimal solution. In this vein, it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the modeling of particular problems or to present empirical results. Instead, our study aims to consider, share points of view and/or promote a deeper discussion among researchers who use MCDA. By highlighting some of the main characteristics of MCDA and contributing to the MCDA diffusion, this paper might be a starting point to forecast potential developments in the field. © Fernando A.F.

abstract={The increasing importance and complexity of land and natural resource management are creating a need for ecosystem-based management (EBM). Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) combined with geographic information systems (GIS) can integrate factors related to the triple bottom line of ecological, economic, and social perspectives required by EBM. However, GIS-based MCDA is limited in this role because (i) it rarely integrates or encourages an exploration phase in preparation for structured evaluation and (ii) inexperienced users may find MCDA methods and GIS software difficult to use. This paper presents a novel approach for (i) supporting an exploration phase to help structure a problem and (ii) integrating the exploration and evaluation phases in an easy-to-use software system. The approach was validated through a land-management case study in a forest-dominated landscape with a variety of stakeholders. Case-study participants used the approach to rate areas within a timber harvest plan based on their potential for conflict with conservation values. The case-study decision analysis determined that between 1.3% and 6.6% of the harvest plan area had a conservation rating of 0.30 or higher on a scale of 0-1. The system was made available to the forest industry and other stakeholders to support harvest plan adjustments, demonstrating how such tools can be used to improve and integrate our knowledge of forest ecology and management. Assessment of participant feedback reveals that an exploration phase is effective in helping understand a problem and prepare for multiple criteria evaluation (MCE). © 2010.},

abstract={Energy security is the capacity to avoid adverse impact of disruptions from natural, accidental, or intentional events affecting energy and utility supply and distributions systems [1]. The integration of multiple fuel sources, use of regional renewable energies, consideration of cultural acceptance, defined criteria and metrics, and appropriate research and development all constitute a plan for achieving energy security [2]. When evaluating alternative investment strategies in energy security for military and industrial facilities, it is important to consider future scenarios of the energy environment. Some scenarios may be evidence-based projections derived from geographic, regulatory, geopolitical, and other driving forces. Other scenarios could reflect the advocacy positions of various stakeholders in a large-scale infrastructure or military/industrial system. This paper reflects a philosophy to incorporate uncertain scenarios to update a scoring function of a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The approach identifies what scenarios most affect the prioritization of investment portfolios, and what portfolios are most opportunistic or vulnerable across the scenarios. The approach efficiently adjusts the scoring function and is therefore suitable for considering a potentially large set of scenarios in stakeholder negotiation, group decision making, and brainstorming.},

abstract={BHC Ltd is a family owned SME which specialises in steel fabrication for the construction industry. Due to rapid growth over the past decade the company's current business software has evolved from a collection of semi-integrated individual packages and Excel spreadsheets. To help the company become more efficient during the current financial downturn and to ensure they are capable of future growth, BHC Ltd initiated a project with the University of Strathclyde to select and implement an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution. This paper will provide a case study of BHC's ERP selection process. In particular it will discuss how steel specific business requirements and organisational culture led us to use multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) when making a final software selection. The MCDA process that was followed is further discussed and includes the success that was achieved by using this approach. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

abstract={Many companies are engaged in increasing their productivity and improving the quality of their products and operations. A means to achieve such improvements is to adopt Business Process Management practices. Techniques to analyze, evaluate and improve business processes are deemed Business Process Modeling. Currently, there are several methodologies and techniques for modeling to choose from. The business process modeling method selected for modeling can directly impact on the result of BPM. Therefore, in order to help both academics and practitioners, a model is proposed that will sort business process modeling methods based on the objectives of modeling using the ELECTRE TRI method. This model can serve as a basis for evaluating modeling methods, and thus act as a guide for organizations and serve for a pre-analysis that may support future choice. We use a Product Development process in an automobile company as an example to demonstrate the model. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={An analysis framework to address dynamic multiple criteria decision analysis (DMCDA) is proposed and its application in emergency management assessment is studied to demonstrate the designed analysis procedure. First, DMCDA is proposed as an extension of a classic static multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problem. The key idea is that DMCDA is considering multiple copies information such as time series data to reflect the overall situation of alternatives over different criteria. The DMCDA is modeled and different decision strategies to aggregate multiple copies of information is discussed. Finally, a case study in emergency management assessment is used to illustrate the method. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={In computing clouds, it is desirable to avoid wasting resources as a result of under-utilization and to avoid lengthy response times as a result of over-utilization. In this paper, we propose a new approach for dynamic autonomous resource management in computing clouds. The main contribution of this work is two-fold. First, we adopt a distributed architecture where resource management is decomposed into independent tasks, each of which is performed by Autonomous Node Agents that are tightly coupled with the physical machines in a data center. Second, the Autonomous Node Agents carry out configurations in parallel through Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis using the PROMETHEE method. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is promising in terms of scalability, feasibility and flexibility. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Forest planning in a participatory context often involves multiple stakeholders with conflicting interests. A promising approach for handling these complex situations is to integrate participatory planning and multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The objective of this paper is to analyze strengths and weaknesses of such an integrated approach, focusing on how the use of MCDA has influenced the participatory process. The paper outlines a model for a participatory MCDA process with five steps: stakeholder analysis, structuring of the decision problem, generation of alternatives, elicitation of preferences, and ranking of alternatives. This model was applied in a case study of a planning process for the urban forest in Lycksele, Sweden. In interviews with stakeholders, criteria for four different social groups were identified. Stakeholders also identified specific areas important to them and explained what activities the areas were used for and the forest management they wished for there. Existing forest data were combined with information from interviews to create a map in which the urban forest was divided into zones of different management classes. Three alternative strategic forest plans were produced based on the zonal map. The stakeholders stated their preferences individually by the Analytic Hierarchy Process in inquiry forms and a ranking of alternatives and consistency ratios were determined for each stakeholder. Rankings of alternatives were aggregated; first, for each social group using the arithmetic mean, and then an overall aggregated ranking was calculated from the group rankings using the weighted arithmetic mean. The participatory MCDA process in Lycksele is assessed against five social goals: incorporating public values into decisions, improving the substantive quality of decisions, resolving conflict among competing interests, building trust in institutions, and educating and informing the public. The results and assessment of the case study support the integration of participatory planning and MCDA as a viable option for handling complex forest-management situations. Key issues related to the MCDA methodology that need to be explored further were identified: 1) the handling of place-specific criteria, 2) development of alternatives, 3) the aggregation of individual preferences into a common preference, and 4) application and evaluation of the integrated approach in real case studies. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={One of the most difficult tasks in multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is determining the weights of individual criteria so that all alternatives can be compared based on the aggregate performance of all criteria. This problem can be transformed into the compromise programming of seeking alternatives with a shorter distance to the ideal or a longer distance to the anti-ideal despite the rankings based on the two distance measures possibly not being the same. In order to obtain consistent rankings, this paper proposes a measure of relative distance, which involves the calculation of the relative position of an alternative between the anti-ideal and the ideal for ranking. In this case, minimizing the distance to the ideal is equivalent to maximizing the distance to the anti-ideal, so the rankings obtained from the two criteria are the same. An example is used to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method, and the results are compared with those obtained from the TOPSIS method. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This chapter focuses on a review of Geographic Information Systembased Multicriteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA). These two distinctive areas of research can benefit from each other. On the one hand, GIS techniques and procedures have an important role to play in analyzing spatial decision problems. Indeed, GIS is often recognized as a spatial decision support system. On the other hand, MCDA provides a rich collection of techniques and procedures for structuring decision problems, designing, evaluating, and prioritizing alternative decisions. At the most rudimentary level, GIS-MCDA can be thought of as a process that transforms and combines geographical (spatial) data and value judgments (the decision maker’s preferences) to obtain information for decision making. It is in the context of the synergetic capabilities of GIS and MCDA that one can see the benefit for advancing theoretical and applied research on GIS-MCDA. The chapter is structured into seven sections. The introductory section outlines the synergetic capabilities of GIS and MCDA. Subsequently, the chapter provides an introduction to the basic concepts of GIS, a historical perspective of GIS-MCDA, and a survey of the GIS-MCDA literature. The following section focuses on the MCDA functions in GIS-based analysis and Multicriteria Spatial Decision Support System (MC-SDSS). The concluding section presents the challenges and prospects for advancing GIS-MCDA. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

abstract={This chapter addresses two complementary themes in relation to problem structuring and MCDA. The first and primary theme highlights the nature and importance of problem structuring for MCDA and then reviews suggested ways for how this process may be approached. The integrated use of problem structuring methods (PSMs) and MCDA is one such approach; this potential is explored in greater depth and illustrated by four short case studies. In reflecting on these and other experiences we conclude with a brief discussion of the complementary theme that MCDA can also be viewed as creating a problem structure within which many other standard tools of OR may be applied, and could therefore also be viewed as a PSM. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

abstract={In this paper, it is described how multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods, in particular the Evidential Reasoning (ER) approach, is applied to help Tesco, the largest UK retailer, to prioritise product groups for its carbon labelling program. The main objectives of the program are to maximise the positive impact of the program to the environment in terms of carbon footprint reduction, while not to introduce unintentionally non-carbon related risks such as resource depletion, pollution and ethical risks. The application is focused on comparing both the positive and negative impacts of labelling different product groups so that the ones with the relatively higher positive impacts are recommended for early participation in the program. The main challenges of the application are uncertainties in data and judgements, such as lack of data, inaccuracy of data estimates and weights of different criteria. It is demonstrated with examples how those challenges can be dealt with by applying the ER approach for MCDA. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Agricultural decisions typically involve multiple criteria, some of which are subjective. Business, environmental, and lifestyle criteria are all important criteria in these decisions. These criteria can be difficult to trade-off using traditional methods. Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) provides a formal, quantitative means of evaluating agricultural decisions taking all these factors into account. MCDA for agricultural decisions was evaluated using three applied case studies (use of new processing technology, selection of beef policies, and selection of farm systems in an environmentally sensitive catchment). The case studies all differed in their problem types and decision-maker requirements. A multi-attribute value theory approach was used for all the cases. This approach was selected using a descriptive framework which took the method limitations, problem attributes, and decision-maker requirements into account. The differences between the case studies, the application and the implementation of MCDA, the overall success of the process, and the potential use of MCDA in agriculture going forward are discussed. While MCDA was used to help identify the best decision, the main benefits that the decision makers identified included: learning about the decision, a better understanding of their own and others’ perspectives, a structured way to work through the decision, a means to explain the decision, and stimulation of discussion and sharing of ideas. These benefits were particularly important for the group decisions. Participants were not overly concerned with the ranking accuracy. Problems in implementation included an initial lack of commitment to the process, understanding of the process and decision, and ownership of the decision. The limited time decision makers had available contributed to this. The majority of the decision makers liked the MCDA process for these strategic decisions. The quantitative approach and the graphic presentation appealed to them. Hence, simple MCDA approaches may be as effective as more complex ones, and can deliver many of the benefits particularly where the time is limited. There has been interest in the use of MCDA going forward. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Material selection of highly sensitive components is one of the most challenging issues in the design and development of structural elements in aerospace and nuclear industry. This work compares some of the most widely potential multi-criteria decision making models for addressing all the stages in solving a material selection problem of highly sensitive components involving conflicting as well as multiple design objectives. For the first step, the compensatory models are discussed and employed to solve a multi-criteria material selection for a thermal loaded conductor in the presence of its required multi-functional characteristics. For the next step, using different versions of the non-compensatory methods examine the outranking approach to solve the same problem. The results are compared to each other to verify the effect of compensations and non-compensations in the methods and their sensitivity to ranking stability. It is of particular interest to see how different approaches of the Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) models differ from each other when criterion of cost is a critical factor in the problem. The effect of individual attributes of cost criterion has been studied to ensure the reliability of the chosen candidate material by MADM models. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The viability of introducing milk futures contracts in Brazil was assessed through a combination of multiple criteria decision analysis and the application of traditional principles from the theory of success and failure of futures trading. Commodity-specific attributes and market-related aspects were analyzed for chilled raw milk, ultra high temperature (UHT) milk, and milk powder. The analytic hierarchy process methodology was used to rank the commodities in terms of their feasibility prospects. Among them, it was ascertained that chilled raw milk is the most suitable for futures trading. Major reasons for this result are the product's high price volatility, the competitive nature of its markets, the absence of competing risk-management tools, and the impossibility of cross-hedging. Complementing the analysis, interviews were conducted with the 100 largest milk producers in the country to assess their perceptions regarding futures trading. Approximately 92% of these farmers expressed an interest in adopting milk futures contracts as price risk management tools. In conclusion, the analysis indicated that the introduction of a milk futures contract in Brazil has a high probability of success. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a real-world case realized in Switzerland on behalf of the federal agency in charge of the waste policy. The incineration of urban wastes generates hazardous residues that need specific treatment and/or land-filling technologies. The variety of local situations and appraisals led to the choice of very different solutions. Moreover, proponents were keen to propose new technologies. The purpose of this study was to provide the background for a national policy that would apply to all future projects. A working group with representatives of the national, county and local levels was in charge of this study. Multiple criteria decision analysis has been used as a framework integrating in a structured way inputs from policy and technology. Technology provides what is feasible (the alternatives and their characteristics); policy provides what is desirable (the criteria and their importance). The aggregation of these two types of inputs in a transparent way generates results that are hopefully understood by and acceptable for all actors. In the study, 23 alternatives were analyzed on about 25 criteria and sub-criteria. The aggregation took into account the group members' and "artificial" weights. The results did not bring forward any alternative in particular and thus tended to legitimate the various solutions adopted; nevertheless, some technologies could be seen as worse than many others. We emphasize here the difficulty to handle multiple results and present how we coped with this issue. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Screening is a process for multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) that reduces a large set of alternatives to a smaller set that most likely contains the best choice. To study screening in detail, MCDA is first interpreted as consequence-based preference aggregation. Consequence data and preference expressions (values and weights) are defined and the aggregation steps are elaborated. Based on these concepts, screening and sequential screening are defined and their properties are discussed. Then, it is shown how several popular MCDA methods can be integrated into a decision support system for sequential screening based upon available decision information. Finally, an illustrative application to water supply planning is presented. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Implementation of integrated catchment management (ICM) is hampered by the lack of a conceptual framework for explaining how landowners select farming systems for their properties. Benefit-cost analysis (a procedure that estimates the costs and benefits of alternative actions or policies) has limitations in this regard, which might be overcome by using multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). MCDA evaluates and ranks alternatives based on a landowner's preferences (weights) for multiple-criteria and the values of those criteria. A MCDA approach to ICM is superior to benefit-cost analysis which focuses only on the monetary benefits and costs, because it: 1) recognizes that human activities within a catchment are motivated by multiple and often competing criteria and/or constraints; 2) does not require monetary valuation of criteria; 3) allows trade-offs between criteria to be measured and evaluated; 4) explicitly considers how the spatial configuration of farming systems in a catchment influences the values of criteria; 5) is comprehensive, knowledge-based, and stakeholder oriented which greatly increases the likelihood of resolving catchment problems; and 6) allows consideration of the fairness and sustainability of land and water resource management decisions. A MCDA based on an additive, multiple-criteria utility function containing five economic and environmental criteria was used to score and rank five farming systems. The rankings were based on the average criteria weights for a sample of 20 farmers in a US catchment. The most profitable farming system was the lowest-ranked farming system. Three possible reasons for this result are evaluated. First, the MCDA method might cause respondents to express socially acceptable attitudes towards environmental criteria even when they are not important from a personal viewpoint. Second, the MCDA method could inflate the ranks of less profitable farming systems for the simple reason that it allows the respondent to assign non-zero weights to non-economic criteria. Third, the MCDA might provide a better framework for evaluating a landowner's selection of farming systems than the profit maximization model. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The National Water Act (NWA) of 1998 has been promulgated in South Africa to support the attainment of sustainable water resource use. Before the Act was promulgated, landowners were entitled to unlimited groundwater use. The Act rectified this anomaly; however, the practical application of sustainable development concepts in groundwater resource management will be complex. A multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach was used to identify critical alternative courses of action and to develop a decision-making framework for sustainable groundwater management. Through applying the decision model described in this paper a number of strategies have been proposed which are aligned to the legislative requirements of the NWA.},

abstract={The criteria describing the problem of evaluation of the heating system for buildings have been proposed. The criteria have an open character, and it is the decision maker who indicates which will be taken into account, so that those accepted for the evaluation of variants may allow for a thorough description of the analysed problem. The analysis of the final number of technically acceptable solutions, based on the final number of describing criteria, can help indicate the most compromised choice of the heating system. Therefore, one of the multicriteria methods of decision aiding has been proposed. The research uses ELECTRE III which allows for a multicriteria assessment of a heating system for an educational building.},

abstract={Sorting is a process for multiple criteria decision analysis that arranges a set of alternatives into ordinally defined groups. Based on weighted Euclidean distance, a case-based distance model is proposed for sorting using weights and group thresholds obtained by assessment of a case set. A quadratic optimization program is employed to find optimal weights and group thresholds. Instead of direct inquiry, this case-based method can elicit the decision maker's preferences more expeditiously and accurately. A case study on Canadian municipal water usage analysis is presented. ©2005 IEEE.},

abstract={Sustainable development is a multidimensional concept, including socio-economic, ecological, technical and ethical perspectives. In making sustainability policies operational, basic questions to be answered are sustainability of what and whom? As a consequence, sustainability issues are characterised by a high degree of conflict. The main objective of this Chapter is to show that multiple-criteria decision analysis is an adequate approach for dealing with sustainability conflicts at both micro and macro levels of analysis. To achieve this objective, lessons, learned from both theoretical arguments and empirical experience, are reviewed. Guidelines of “good practice” are suggested too. © 2005, Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

abstract={An approach for the analysis and management of multiple criteria critical infrastructure problems is put forth. Nuclear waste management involves complex tradeoffs under uncertainty. Among all waste either generated by nature or human activities, radioactive nuclear waste is the most toxic to human health and difficult to manage: it is known that some nuclear waste material will be radioactive and potentially dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years. This paper discusses the use of multiple criteria decision analysis techniques such as the analytic hierarchy process for recommending sites to be considered as potential repositories for nuclear waste.

abstract={A range of funding schemes and policy instruments exist to effect enhancement of the landscapes and habitats of the UK. While a number of assessments of these mechanisms have been conducted, little research has been undertaken to compare both quantitatively and qualitatively their relative effectiveness across a range of criteria. It is argued that few tools are available for such a multi-faceted evaluation of effectiveness. A form of Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is justified and utilized as a framework in which to evaluate the effectiveness of nine mechanisms in relation to the protection of existing areas of chalk grassland and the creation of new areas in the South Downs of England. These include established schemes, such as the Countryside Stewardship and Environmentally Sensitive Area Schemes, along with other less common mechanisms, for example, land purchase and tender schemes. The steps involved in applying an MCDA to evaluate such mechanisms are identified and the process is described. Quantitative results from the comparison of the effectiveness of different mechanisms are presented, although the broader aim of the paper is that of demonstrating the performance of MCDA as a tool for measuring the effectiveness of mechanisms aimed at landscape and habitat enhancement. © 2004 University of Newcastle upon Tyne.},

abstract={An interactive method intended to solve multiple criteria decision analysis problems with a large number of discrete alternatives and a few criteria is proposed in the paper. The decision-maker (DM) sets his/her local preferences in terms of desired or acceptable changes in the criteria values for some criteria and the desired or acceptable change of directions for a few of the remaining criteria. A small ordered set of relatively "close" alternatives is defined with the help of a scalarizing problem. If required by the DM, this set is ranked by a formal procedure on the basis of the local intra- And intercriteria information provided by him/her. The ranked set is presented to the DM who selects the most preferred alternative or enters his/her new preferences for improving the current alternative. The software realization of the interactive method proposed is included in an experimental decision support system called MultiChoice for solving multicriteria analysis problems.

abstract={Design of solid-waste management systems requires consideration of multiple alternative solutions and evaluation criteria because the systems can have complex and conflicting impacts on different stakeholders. Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been found to be a fruitful approach to solve this design problem. In this paper, the MCDA approach is applied to solve the landfill selection problem in Regina of Saskatchewan Canada. The systematic approach of MCDA helps decision makers select the most preferable decision and provides the basis of a decision support system. The techniques that are used in this study include: 1) Simple Weighted Addition method, 2) Weighted Product method, 3) TOPSIS, 4) cooperative game theory, and 5) ELECTRE. The results generated with these methods are compared and ranked so that the most preferable solution is identified.},

abstract={The paper describes a decision support system (DSS) for multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). It is assumed that the information about the trade-offs is given in the form of lower and upper bounds. The software helps the user to identify candidate solutions from a finite set of decision alternatives and can be used in an interactive decision process. The choice of the software features is based on the author's experience with an environmental case study, which is discussed.},

abstract={This paper discusses multiple criteria models of decision analysis with finite sets of alternatives. A weighted sum of criteria is used to evaluate the performance of alternatives. Information about the weights is assumed to be in the form of arbitrary linear constraints. Conditions for checking dominance and potential optimality of decision alternatives are presented. In the case of testing potential optimality, the proposed appoach leads to the consideration of a couple of mutually dual linear programming problems. The analysis of these problems gives valuable information for the decision maker. In particular, if a decision alternative is not potentially optimal, then a mixed alternative dominating it is defined by a solution to one of the LP problems. This statement generalizes similar results known for some special cases. The interpretation of the mixed alternative is discussed and compared to its analogue in a data envelopment analysis context. © 1997 Operational Research Society Ltd.},

abstract={A method is proposed for the analysis of multiple criteria decision making problems in an interactive environment, when decision-maker preferences are inconsistent with a simple utility model and/or are self-inconsistent (e. g. showing intransitivities). A maximum likelihood estimation procedure is invoked which is based on a logistic regression model relating the probability of selecting one decision option over another to a linear function of attribute values. The method is illustrated by application to multi-objective linear programming, where it serves as an alternative to the method of S. Zionts and J. Wallenius, and allows for inconsistencies which are not satisfactorily handled in the S. Zionts-J. Wallenius approach.},
