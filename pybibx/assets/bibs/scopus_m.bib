	abstract = {In this paper, Base-criterion method (BCM) is proposed to solve multi-criteria decision-making problems. According to BCM, instead of executing a pairwise comparisons between all criteria or executing a pairwise comparisons between each of the best and worst criteria to other criteria, one of the criteria is chosen by the decision-maker as a base-criterion (e.g. preferential, selective) and then pairwise comparisons between base-criterion and other criteria are obtained. Then, a max-min problem is formulated and solved to determine the weight of the criteria. In this way, the pairwise comparisons to obtain weights of the criteria are fully consistent. In other ability of BCM, we find the lost pairwise comparisons by using the BCM framework so that the pairwise comparisons matrix remains consistent. To illustrate the reliability of the proposed method and evaluate its performance to determine the weights, we have used two numerical examples. The outcomes of numerical examples indicate that the BCM has high accuracy and better consistency ratio than the other multi-criteria decision-making(MCDM) methods. The cause of high consistency ratio in the BCM is the dependency of pairwise comparisons between criteria. Moreover, we have used two other numerical examples to illustrate the function of the BCM in order to find out the missing comparisons in incomplete pairwise comparison matrix. We have shown the BCM framework able to find lost comparisons in the worst terms of the incomplete pairwise comparison matrix. The outcomes of the proposed article show that BCM performance is significantly better than AHP and BWM methods with respect to the consistency ratio, and it requires fewer comparison data and has the ability to calculate missing pairwise comparisons. © 2019, © 2019 International Society of Management Science and Engineering Management.},

	abstract = {Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a widely used decision making method in many areas such as management sciences. The performance ratings of multiple criteria and alternatives can be elicited from pairwise comparisons obtained by expressing the decision maker's perceive. However, it may be difficult for the decision maker to prudently assign values to comparisons for large number of criteria or alternatives. Since there exist distinct relationships between any two elements in the real world, the relationship between the missing comparison and the assigned comparisons should be taken into account. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel method using a well-known regression tool, namely the backpropagation multi-layer perceptron (i.e., MLP) to realize the above implicit relationship so as to estimate a missing pairwise judgment from the other assigned entries. A computer simulation is employed to demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively find a missing entry of an incomplete pairwise matrix such that its consistency index is minimized. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The weight vector is obtained from the pairwise comparison matrix of the item on the viewpoints given by a decision maker. The comparison matrix is incomplete in the sense of the missing comparisons and inconsistency among the comparisons. As for the missing comparisons, we assume the inclusion relation between the given comparison and the obtained interval weights as in Interval Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). As for the inconsistency, we assume the comparison matrices of the other items by the decision maker and find out his/her consistency degree. Moreover, the incompleteness motivates us to consider the other decision makers who give the comparison matrices of the item. In other words, all the given comparisons are reliable since a decision maker need not give the comparisons if s/he is not confident in it. It is reasonable that the weight vector of the item should be the core of those of all the decision makers. The weight vector of each decision with a higher consistency degree is more preferable. However, there is a trade-off among the consistency degree, the inclusion relation, and the core condition. We introduce a fuzzy approach, which simultaneously minimizes the relaxations of the inclusion relation and the core condition and maximizes the consistency degree, to obtain the weight vector of the target item. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a decision analysis technique used to evaluate complex multiattribute alternatives among one or more decision makers. It imposes a hierarchical structure on any complex multicriterion problem. However, a major drawback of the AHP is that a large number of pairwise comparisons is needed to calibrate the hierarchy. When there are a few levels and sublevels, the AHP can be applied in a straightforward manner to derive the weights (relative preference for each alternative). As the size of the hierarchy increases, the number of pairwise comparisons increases rapidly. It is well established in the marketing and consumer behavior literature that in a very long interview, even under the best circumstances, the respondent is likely to suffer from information overload. Recognition of this problem was the motivation which led to the investigation of a modification of AHP which required less data collection, i.e., a reduction in the threat of information overload. The first question to be answered is the effect on AHP weights due to different patterns of missing data likely to result from reallife data collection. In this study, a Monte Carlo simulation was conducted, which uses the Incomplete Pairwise Comparisons (IPC) algorithm [14], to investigate the effect of reduced sets of pairwise comparisons in the AHP. Data for the study were generated with known structure and comparisons made between complete and incomplete matrices. The results of the simulation suggest that incomplete sets of pairwise comparison matrices can capture the attribute level weights without significant loss of accuracy and independent of decision model (form and amount of error) considered. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {The complementary judgment matrix (CJM) method is an MCDA (multicriteria decision aiding) method based on pairwise comparisons. As in AHP, the decision-maker (DM) can specify his/her preferences using pairwise comparisons, both between different criteria and between different alternatives with respect to each criterion. The DM specifies his/her preferences by allocating two nonnegative comparison values so that their sum is 1. We measure and pinpoint possible inconsistency by inconsistency errors. We also compare the consistency of CJM and AHP trough simulation. Because preference judgments are always more or less imprecise or uncertain, we introduce a way to represent the uncertainty through stochastic distributions, and a computational method to treat the uncertainty. As in Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA), we consider different uncertainty levels: precise comparisons, imprecise comparisons with a stochastic distribution, and missing comparisons between criteria. We compute rank acceptability indices for the alternatives, describing the probability of an alternative to obtain a given rank considering the level of uncertainty and study the influence of the uncertainty on the SMAA-CJM results. © 2018 Haichao Wang et al.},

The formal proofs suggest that CPM alone is sufficient to fix both missing judgments and inconsistency of PCM in AHP. Based on this well grounded merit, a procedure is proposed to improve consistency for incomplete PCM.

The presented article is an attempt to bridge this gap. The aim of the article is to examine how the incompleteness of a set of paired comparisons influences the sensitivity of the PC method. During the research, two important factors related to the incompleteness of PC matrices have been identified, namely the number of missing pairwise comparisons and their arrangements. Accordingly, an easy-to-calculate incompleteness index have been developed. It takes into account both the total number of missing data and their distribution in the PC matrix. During the series of Montecarlo experiments, the properties of this index have been examined. It demonstrated that both the incompleteness and inconsistency of data almost equally contribute to the sensitivity of the PC matrix. The relative simplicity of the proposed index may help decision makers to quickly estimate the impact of missing comparisons on the quality of final results. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Decision-making is frequently affected by uncertainty and/or incomplete information, which turn decision-making into a complex task. It is often the case that some of the actors involved in decision-making are not sufficiently familiar with all of the issues to make the appropriate decisions. In this paper, we are concerned about missing information. Specifically, we deal with the problem of consistently completing an analytic hierarchy process comparison matrix and make use of graph theory to characterize such a completion. The characterization includes the degree of freedom of the set of solutions and a linear manifold and, in particular, characterizes the uniqueness of the solution, a result already known in the literature, for which we provide a completely independent proof. Additionally, in the case of nonuniqueness, we reduce the problem to the solution of nonsingular linear systems. In addition to obtaining the priority vector, our investigation also focuses on building the complete pairwise comparison matrix, a crucial step in the necessary process (between synthetic consistency and personal judgement) with the experts. The performance of the obtained results is confirmed. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

This is one of the efforts to reduce the number of comparisons that need to be provided by an expert. The results show that a complete pairwise matrix that is consistent tends to have the same characteristics (priority sequence and consistency index) as when it has one missing value.

Our intention is to numerically minimize a maximum eigenvalue function, which is difficult to write explicitly in terms of variables, subject to interval constraints. Numerical simulations are carried out in order to examine the performance of the algorithm. The results of our simulations show that the proposed algorithm has the ability to solve the minimization of the constrained eigenvalue problem.

	abstract = {Heuristic rating estimation is a newly proposed method that supports decisions analysis based on the use of pairwise comparisons. It allows the ranking values of some alternatives (herein referred to as concepts) to be initially known, whilst ranks for other concepts have yet to be estimated. To calculate the missing ranks it is assumed that the priority of every single concept can be determined as the weighted arithmetic mean of the priorities of all the other concepts. It has been shown that the problem has an admissible solution if the inconsistency of the pairwise comparisons is not too high. The proposed approach adopts heuristics according to which a weighted geometric mean is used to determine the missing priorities. In this approach, despite increased complexity, a solution always exists and its existence does not depend on the inconsistency or reciprocity of the input matrix. Thus, the presented approach might be appropriate for a larger number of problems than previous methods. Moreover, it turns out that the geometric approach, as proposed in the article, can be optimal. The optimality condition is presented in the form of a corresponding theorem. A formal definition of the proposed geometric heuristics is accompanied by two numerical examples. © 2014, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In unconventional emergency decision making process using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), it is important to quickly collect and process experts' opinions to make a rapid decision. Questionnaire survey is a commonly used way to collect opinions and views in the AHP. However, many factors such as tedious design format, redundant content, and long length, may lead to inconsistent comparison matrix for the decision problem. Invalid or bad results of a questionnaire survey may cause the decision makers to make wrong decision. Furthermore, in the AHP, the score items for a comparison matrix in a questionnaire increase drastically if there are more comparisons, which result in longer survey. In this paper, a scale format is used to design the score items for a comparison matrix in questionnaire survey. Besides, an induced bias matrix model (IBMM) is proposed to estimate the missing item scores of the reciprocal pairwise comparison matrix. The survey questionnaire can be improved according to the importance of score items and emergency degree of the surveyed questions. A numerical example is used to illustrate the proposed method in unconventional emergency decision making. In addition, three cases of this example are analyzed and compared to address the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed estimation model in the survey questionnaire design. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

If these matrices have missing elements, they must be completed previous to the calculation of the principal eigenvector.

This paper generalises the famous rule of thumb for the acceptable level of inconsistency, proposed by Saaty, to incomplete pairwise comparison matrices. The extension is based on choosing the missing elements such that the maximal eigenvalue of the incomplete matrix is minimised. Consequently, the well-established values of the random index cannot be adopted: the inconsistency of random matrices is found to be the function of matrix size and the number of missing elements, with a nearly linear dependence in the case of the latter variable.

The algorithm is used successfully to recover parameters from a simulated data set. No one has previously described such an extension of the pairwise algorithm to a Rasch model that includes both ordered categories and rater effects. The paired comparisons technique has importance for several reasons: it relies on the separability of parameters that is true only for the Rasch measurement model; it works in the presence of missing data; it makes transparent the connectivity needed for parameter estimation; and it is very simple. The technique also shares the mathematical framework of a very popular technique in the social sciences called the Analytic Hierarchy Process (Saaty, 1996).},

	abstract = {Pairwise comparison matrix (PCM) as a crucial component of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) presents the preference relations among alternatives. However, in many cases, the PCM is difficult to be completed, which obstructs the subsequent operations of the classical AHP. In this paper, based on decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method which has ability to derive the total relation matrix from direct relation matrix, a new completion method for incomplete pairwise comparison matrix (iPCM) is proposed. The proposed method provides a new perspective to estimate the missing values in iPCMs with explicit physical meaning, which is straightforward and flexible. Several experiments are implemented as well to present the completion ability of the proposed method and some insights into the proposed method and matrix consistency. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In the context of some multi-criteria decision-making methods, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process, an expert is required to compare entities, e.g. alternatives and criteria. However, often, for various reasons, the expert cannot provide judgments on all pairs of entities. For these cases, several completion methods have been proposed in the literature to estimate the missing values of pairwise comparison matrices. In this paper, we study the similarity of eleven completion methods on the basis of numerical simulations and hierarchical clustering. We perform simulations for matrices of different orders considering various numbers of missing comparisons. Finally, the results suggest the existence of a cluster of five extremely similar methods, and a method significantly dissimilar from all the others. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Selecting relevant features to make a decision and expressing the relationships between these features is not a simple task. The decision maker must precisely define the alternatives and criteria which are more important for the decision making process. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) uses hierarchical structures to facilitate this process. The comparison is realized using pairwise matrices, which are filled in according to the decision maker judgments. Subsequently, matrix consistency is tested and priorities are obtained by calculating the matrix principal eigenvector. Given an incomplete pairwise matrix, two procedures must be performed: first, it must be completed with suitable values for the missing entries and, second, the matrix must be improved until a satisfactory level of consistency is reached. Several methods are used to fill in missing entries for incomplete pairwise matrices with correct comparison values. Additionally, once pairwise matrices are complete and if comparison judgments between pairs are not consistent, some methods must be used to improve the matrix consistency and, therefore, to obtain coherent results. In this paper a model based on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network is presented. Given an AHP pairwise matrix, this model is capable of completing missing values and improving the matrix consistency at the same time. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
