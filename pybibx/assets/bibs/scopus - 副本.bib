abstract={In this paper, we present (to the best of our knowledge) the first outranking method to assign a score to each alternative. This method is part of the ELECTRE family, and we will call it ELECTRE-SCORE. In contrast to the Multi-Attribute Value Theory methods, ELECTRE-SCORE does not construct a value function for each criterion to proceed then to the aggregation into a single value. Instead, ELECTRE-SCORE makes use of the outranking relations to make a comparison with sets of reference actions (to which a score is assigned) and assigns a score range to each action and a representative score in the range to each action. This is a more robust way of proceeding given the fragility of a single score. The reference actions have similar nature and characteristics of limiting profiles in ELECTRE TRI-NB and the reference scores are assigned to them through the application of the deck of cards technique. Because this method uses outranking relations, it makes also possible to take into account the imperfect knowledge of data and to avoid systematic compensatory effects. Some fundamental theoretical results guaranteeing the consistency of the method, an illustrative example and a case study in the domain of healthcare system evaluation are also provided in this paper. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={For construction companies, the decision about whether to bid for a project is a strategic decision. This paper provides a model for assessing project attractiveness levels and deciding whether to submit a proposal. The model introduces a classification model that incorporates fuzzy preferential information to evaluate project attractiveness under multiple dimensions and enables the decision-maker to make more effective decisions. Projects are assigned to ordinal categories of attractiveness based on an adapted fuzzy ELECTRE TRI-C procedure. The main advantages of this model are that the attractiveness level can be used as an input for the bidding strategies, the attractiveness evaluation can support the contractor in prioritizing the projects to bid on, and the model captures the decision process's subjective assessments and situations of imprecision observed on early phases of the project life cycle. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Multidimensional risk assessment for natural gas pipelines has proved to be an efficient approach for companies to evaluate multiple risk perspectives and to determine different mitigation actions. Therefore, making decisions to ensure the system's best performance, taking into account safety issues, is a challenging task. This paper proposes a multidimensional risk classification with global sensitivity analysis by making a structured analysis of uncertainty that uses a Monte Carlo Simulation and visualization tools. For this analysis, five scenarios of a group of parameters are set according to operational and technical issues, consequences and the preferential properties of the model for pipeline sections. Then, sensitivity levels are statistically validated and defined for each section, thereby generating information on modifications to the classification of levels of risk. For example, 10% variation in the group of parameters related to the Critical Danger Radius (CDR), 6 out of 8 pipeline sections present high sensitivity levels; showing that their original risk classifications do not remain the same. Also, 4 sections are expected to be in the high risk class, while 1 section is expected to be in medium class and 3 sections in the low risk class. Consequently, managers should prioritize mitigation strategies to those sections with significant risk categories The advantages of our proposals are twofold. First, the proposed methodology enables decisions to be made on classifying risks which incorporate evidence on the sensitivity and uncertainties of natural gas pipelines. Secondly, effective information on classifying risk is provided to the decision-maker by using statistical validations and visualization tools. Thus, managers can enhance their perception of risks with regard to a natural gas pipeline, can generate insights to control mitigations and allocate resources to ensure safety for people, and can avoid losses regarding the environment and their companies' properties. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The present paper addresses the relevant topic of maintenance management, widely recognised as a fundamental issue involving complex engineering systems and leading companies towards the optimisation of their assets while pursuing cost efficiency. With this regard, our research aims to provide companies with a hybrid methodological approach based on Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) capable to deal with the main failures potentially involving complex systems subjected to predictive maintenance. Such an approach is going to be integrated within the framework of traditional Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), whose strengths and weaknesses are considered. In particular, the ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE) TRI is suggested to sort failure modes into risk priority classes while the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) is proposed to highlight the most influencing failures within each risk class. The approach is applied to a real service system, whose critical components are monitored by sensors and subjected to predictive maintenance. Final results clearly demonstrate as highlighting the elements impacting the occurrence of other failures within specific risk classes is a significant driver towards the implementation of effective maintenance, maximising the whole level of performance of the analysed system over its lifecycle. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The Portuguese National Health Service (SNS) was created to provide universal, equal, and tendentiously free care. There are different levels of care (primary, secondary, continued, and palliative) and all of them should deliver quality care services. Quality in healthcare is assessed according to several criteria, such as patient safety, care appropriateness or access. However, over the last years political and economic events have had an impact on the SNS. Hence, structural reforms have occurred, and new healthcare policies have been implemented, mostly focused on improving efficiency and reducing costs. It associated to divestment can increment barriers to access, compromise infrastructures and equipment, and, above all, the service's quality. This work aims to assess quality of the Portuguese public hospitals (secondary care providers) in this line. To this aim, we adopt a multiple criteria decision aiding approach, applying the ELECTRE TRI-NC method to build a decision model with intervention of an expert, who acts as the decision maker. Hospitals are assessed and assigned to predefined categories, taking into account the hospitals’ performances on various criteria. Each criterion is characterized by different subcriteria, resulting in a complex criteria tree. Thus, to construct a multidimensional scale for each criterion, we propose an innovative approach using an ELECTRE TRI-based method. The results are analyzed and the robustness of the model is tested. This work's findings may have potential application to healthcare policy and hospital funding in the SNS, in which financial sustainability is a permanent challenge. © 2021},

abstract={We consider multiple criteria sorting problems with preference-ordered classes delimited by a set of boundary profiles. While significantly extending the ELECTRE Tri-B method, we present an integrated framework for modeling indirect preference information and conducting robustness analysis. We allow the Decision Maker (DM) to provide the following three types of holistic judgments: assignment examples, assignment-based pairwise comparisons, and desired class cardinalities. A diversity of recommendation that can be obtained given the plurality of outranking-based sorting models compatible with the DM’s preferences is quantified by means of six types of results. These include possible assignments, class acceptability indices, necessary assignment-based preference relation, assignment-based outranking indices, extreme class cardinalities, and class cardinality indices. We discuss the impact of preference information on the derived outcomes, the interrelations between the exact results computed with mathematical programming and stochastic indices estimated with the Monte Carlo simulations, and new measures for quantifying the robustness of results. The practical usefulness of the approach is illustrated on data from the Financial Times concerning MBA programs. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Government planning has a relevant role in the human development of cities, and the local public sector acts on legal regulations and budget planning to reach high levels of sustainability and human development. However, there is a gap in local governments related to the integration of decision-making preferences considering sustainability and human development in their budget planning. This work explores how the preferences of decision-makers have been considered in published research found in high-impact journals, and how they have been used in practice or not, especially in the public budget planning for the improvement of the governance of municipalities and human quality of life. The methodology integrated a literature review (by Methodi Ordinatio) with a sorting procedure (by the ELECTRE-TRI method) to categorize the selected papers, considering the level of adherence to the theme and the most relevant contributions, and also a systematic procedure organized by lenses analysis, and Simos’ procedure to define the weights for these lenses. The results that were found can help scholars to access discussions about budget planning distribution, mainly considering the aspects related to sustainable and social goals. The research also helps local public managers to make evidence-based decisions developing the city and local governance. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The paper presents a judgmental expert-based process to assess the ship collision risk using the ELECTRE Tri-nC multiple criteria outranking method. The approach first establishes a set of criteria deemed important by navigation experts, all of them experienced nautical officers, to assess the collision risk between two ships in open waters. A deck of cards-based method is then used to determine the weights of each criterion, according to the experts’ preferences. Finally, risk categories chosen by the experts are characterised in terms of multiple reference scenarios, also provided by the experts, and the ELECTRE Tri-nC method is used to assign validation scenarios to the risk categories. The results are compared with the experts’ assessments of the collision risk for the same scenarios and also with the individual assessments made by three experts that have not participated in the development of the decision model. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Implementing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems is currently recognized as a best practice with wide associated possibilities of business improvement for companies. Integrating these kinds of systems with business processes in the most efficient way requires to endeavour as much as possible simplifications for final users, which can be pursued by optimizing crucial software characteristics. The present article proposes a novel Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach to deal with such an issue. Specifically, the ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) TRI technique is suggested to assign ERP modules into predefined and ordered categories according to maintainability and usability, which are useful drivers in evaluating which module of an ERP software should be enhanced with priority. The results prove to have whole beneficial impact on system performance with relation to a case study: improvement evaluations will be identified based on the classes the ERP modules are assigned to by the method. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Urban public transport systems must be economically efficient and additionally environmentally sustainable. Available decision support systems, including multiple criteria decision models, allow identifying which urban public transport vehicles are acceptable and those that should no longer be used in efficient and environmentally friendly cities. Previous research has ranked urban public transport vehicles by applying analytic hierarchy process multi-criteria decision-making models, from economic and non-polluting perspectives. However, until now, the types of vehicles acceptable for fleet renewal have not been identified. This study proposes a consistent combination of the ELECTRE TRI multiple criteria decision sorting method and the DELPHI procedure, the objective of which is to identify which urban public transport vehicles are acceptable, taking into consideration a suggested sustainable threshold, which includes economic and environmental strict requirements. The proposed model is based on 2020 Madrid urban public road transport data, published by Madrid City Council, which were compiled by the authors, and assessed by a panel of 20 experts to identify criteria and factors included in the model. Findings help local administrations to identify which urban public transport vehicles should be progressively replaced by those classified as economically efficient and additionally environmentally sustainable. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={In order to facilitate the decision making in spatial applications, several methods are available to aggregate the performance of decision-makers. The multitude of these methods makes it difficult to choose one method over another. Two main types of methods are used, the outranking methods which are based on bottom-up approach and the hierarchical analysis methods which are based on top-down approach. These methods can be adapted to this kind of applications and can be integrated into GIS which is an essential tool in spatial management and decision making. Methods developed according to the first approach are different from those developed in accordance with the second one. This study aims to present a comparison between two multicriteria decision-making methods ELECTRE (Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) Tri and AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) to assess land suitability for agriculture. Twelve criteria [water reserve easily utilizable, drainage, permeability, potential of hydrogen (pH), electrical conductivity, active limestone, cation exchange capacity, soil texture, soil useful depth, slope, availability of labor, proximity (roads)] grouped in five factors (agronomic, planning, land enhancement and improvement, soil conservation and environment protection, and socioeconomic conditions) were used in this study. An application has been carried out on the area of Mleta in Algeria. Two land suitability maps for durum wheat have been produced by the two procedures (optimistic and pessimistic) available in ELECTRE Tri, and another map has been obtained by AHP. After the comparison between the obtained results, it was apparent that ELECTRE Tri is more appropriate for the land suitability assessment for agriculture despite its complexity given the large number of required parameters. The subjective parameters available in ELECTRE Tri make it possible to take into account imprecise data. Another advantage of this method lies in the way of the decision-makers' preferences aggregation and the assignment of the land units to classes of predefined categories. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Considering ergonomic factors in assembly line balancing problems can significantly improve human ergonomic conditions. In this study, a two-stage framework is developed to balance a mixed-model parallel U-shaped assembly line by considering ergonomic risks. In the first stage, according to various ergonomic standards and using the best-worst method and ELECTRE TRI, ergonomic risks of each task are identified and each task is classified into hard, normal, or easy class. In the second stage, a mathematical model of the problem is developed by considering a new objective function to level the number of tasks of each class between stations. This objective ensures that the tasks of each class are distributed equally among stations, resulting in having a roughly equal number of hard, normal, and easy tasks in each station. To solve the problem, a constraint programming model and a heuristic algorithm are developed. Numerical results show that the proposed objective function can level ergonomic risks well. The performance of the proposed solution approaches is examined against six different metaheuristic algorithms. Numerical results indicate the superiority of the constraint programming model for small and medium-size problems and that of the heuristic algorithm for large-size problems. © 2021},

abstract={Multicriteria sorting methods are often used in decision aiding contexts where the objective is to assign alternatives to predefined ordered categories. The Electre Tri family of sorting methods is based on pairwise comparisons of the alternatives with some, possibly fictional, alternatives that are either upper or lower limits of the categories (Electre Tri-B), or one or more typical reference alternatives, that is, representative categories profiles (Electre Tri-C, Tri-nC). In this paper, we are interested in the Electre Tri-nC method and in indirect preference elicitation based on partial information provided by the Decision Maker. We therefore propose, apply and evaluate a preference disaggregation method for learning criteria weights and the credibility threshold used in Electre Tri-nC. The proposed disaggregation method is validated in an experiment using a climate classification problem for light tourism where 62,482 touristic locations are sorted into four categories. A robustness analysis of the method's performance using 150 learning sets is conducted and the results are presented and discussed. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract={E-learning environments can store huge amounts of data on the interaction of learners with the content, assessment and discussion. Yet, after the identification of meaningful patterns or learning behaviour in the data, it is necessary to use these patterns to improve learning environments. It is notable that designs to benefit from these patterns have been developed particularly with the use of educational data mining and learning analytics in the recent times. On the other hand, multi-criteria decision-making methods provide opportunities to researchers to discover and use the patterns in the data obtained from learning environments. This study seeks to discover the patterns in the interaction data gathered from e-learning environments. In this context, the research has two main objectives. Firstly, it aims to utilize the ELECTRE TRI method, which is one of the multi-criteria decision-making methods designed to classify the learners based on the interaction data in different units. Secondly, it aims to analyse the relationship between the classification based on the ELECTRE TRI method and the classification in the real life. To that end, two different interaction data sets obtained from learning management systems at different times are used in this study. The first data set consists of the data on 11 criteria and 78 students whereas the second data set consists of the data on 25 criteria and 65 students. Three different categories are identified in the first data set by the ELECTRE TRI method. Based on this finding, the classification in the ELECTRE TRI method is compared to the real-life classification, which shows a medium-level correlation. Two different categories are identified in the second data set. There is a medium-level correlation between these categories and the real-life classification as well. In conclusion, this study presents discussions on the use of multi-criteria decision-making methods to improve e-learning environments. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) has found many applications in both technical and research sectors. MCA is a way to break the problem into more practicable elements, to permit data and decisions to be judgements to support the elements, and make the right decision. The aim of this paper is to analyze, compare, and make decisions of various current, and future scenarios of different quantifiable indicators for different considerations and various socio-economic aspects. Furthermore, this analysis is used to improve or at least to preserve the environment and natural resources in the basin. In this study an application by a real data set is made, these data are evaluated and extracted from classified satellite images of Loukkos basin, the classification of this satellite images regroups several classes of the data set such as agglomeration, dams, watercourses, croplands, bare soils and forests ... etc. In reality, these data come from different sources like watershed information system (drinking water supply, irrigation system), transportation infrastructures (roads, dams), natural resources (Water, soils, and vegetation), human activities (agriculture, urbanization, and industry) and different socio-economic factors (demography). The main objective of this work is sorting the environmental indicators using the ELECTRE TRI tool, where ten alternatives are considered. We focus the classification of the real data set into the altitude, and the combined surface area factors. The obtained results prove that the classification is stable and the multi-criteria approach ELECTRE-TRI is suitable to a better sorting of the environmental indicators for the Loukkos Basin located in Morocco. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The choice of suitable evaluation methods for the layered evaluation of Interactive Adaptive Systems (IAS) needs the consideration of different factors, leading to a multi-criteria decision analysis problem. This paper proposes the first step toward a Web-based Multi-Criteria Decision Support System (MCDSS). Our proposal is based on a recent multi-criteria decision method called ELECTRE TRI-B-H (Elimination and Choice Translating Reality) to guide the layered evaluation of IAS. The goal is to support the choice of appropriate evaluation methods for individual layers taking into account constraints of the layered evaluation and the individual layers. The appropriateness of each evaluation method is analyzed for the layered evaluation in general and each layer in particular. The use of ELECTRE TRI-B-H method allows decomposing a decision problem into intermediate sub-problems through a hierarchy model and sorting alternative evaluation methods at different levels of the hierarchy. A case study of an adaptive hypermedia system is presented; in this study, the ELECTRE TRI-B-H method has been applied to select the most suitable evaluation methods for each of its layers taking into account the layered evaluation context. The promising results show the feasibility of the proposed approach, leading to various research perspectives. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Management of complex supply networks is a fundamental business topic today. Especially in the presence of many and diverse stakeholders, identifying and assessing those risks having a potential negative impact on the performance of supply processes is of utmost importance and, as a result, implementing focused risk management actions is a current lively field of research. The possibility of supporting Supply Chain Risks Management (SCRM) is herein explored from a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)-based perspective. The sorting method ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE) TRI is proposed as a structural procedure to classify Supply Chain Risks (SCRs) into proper risk classes expressing priority of intervention so as to ease the implementation of prevention and protection measures. This approach is intended to offer structured management insights by means of an immediate identification of the most highly critical risks in a wide set of previously identified SCRs. A real-world case study in the field of the automotive industry is implemented to show the applicability and usefulness of the approach. © 2021, Operational Research Society of India.},

abstract={This paper proposes a non-weighted maximal approach of multi-attribute risk assessment for production accidents, which comes from the Chinese practice of risk management rather than the theoretical weighted multi-attribute approach. The existing literature for risk assessment of pipeline accidents, there is an absence of or lack of explicit consideration of some special dimensions, i.e., environmental pollution as the important derivative disaster. The non-weighted maximal approach is described the maximum function among multiple criteria, which include fatalities, serious injuries, direct economic loss, and environment pollutions. The approach comes from the Chinese government official achievement assessment system with the characteristics of 'one ticket veto system for production safety', and has applied to ex ante assessing likelihood of the accident, and ex post holding the responsible for accidents. At last, applying the case of the Chinese Qingdao oil pipeline accident, the maximal approach is compared with the FN curve criterion, the ALARP principle and the ELECTRE TRI method. The results show that the maximal approach of production safety accident criterion pays more attention to the risk density or risk consequences, which follows the 'cask principle' and is much more useful controlling the risk when targeting the vulnerable links of engineering systems. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of the article was to present the model of integration and cooperation (hybridization) of selected methods of decision support as a specific research procedure. The model is the basis for the construction of the so-called decision-making dashboard, which is the main module of the academic, prototype version of the multi-criteria decision support system - DSS 3.0 [1], [2]. Three methods were hybridized: AHP/ANP and ELECTRE TRI included in the area of multi-criteria decision analysis and the method of identification and econometric evaluation based on multiple regression analysis. Due to the limited volume of the study, the description of the algorithms of these methods was abandoned. The focus was on defining the set of input data common to the above-mentioned methods and on the description of the integration process of the results of the decision analysis obtained with their use, indicating the effects of their synergy. The properties of the model are illustrated on a practical example of employee team assessment (case study). The decision making dashboard provided answers to some interesting questions. How is the ranking of employees shaped? What is the overall assessment of a given employee (or candidate for a position) compared to the results of the entire staff? What is the distribution of the number of assignments of the ranked employees to the established classes (profiles) of multi-criteria assessment? Are the ranking favourites in the group of the highest, average or poorly rated employees? What is the ratio of the level of employees' remuneration to the ratings obtained in the ranking? © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The present paper deals with managerial decisions for Predictive Maintenance (PrdM) of complex service systems. We propose a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach aimed at sorting those failure modes potentially involving critical components into risk classes for interventions prioritisation and maintenance control. In this context, the sorting technique ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE) TRI is applied to support in finding the root causes that can be eliminated for failure prevention and/or minimization. This methodology presents the advantage to not rely on comparisons (as well as on their transitivity) between pairs of elements, simplifying computations for complex systems. To be sorted, decision elements are indeed compared with single reference profiles and the final assignment may constitute a valid alternative to the traditional ranking of failures achievable by other MCDM techniques and, among others, consistency-based methodologies. The proposed approach will be eventually applied to a case study from the industrial reality. © 2021 Proceedings - 26th ISSAT International Conference on Reliability and Quality in Design, RQD 2021.

abstract={ELECTRE TRI-nB is a method designed to sort alternatives evaluated on several attributes into ordered categories. It is an extension of ELECTRE TRI-B that uses several limiting profiles, instead of one, to delimit each category. In a previous paper we have characterized the ordered partitions that can be obtained with ELECTRE TRI-nB, using a simple axiom called linearity. The simplicity of this characterization crucially rests on the possibility to use as many limiting profiles as we like to delimit a category. This is not completely realistic and there is a need to study models in which the number of limiting profiles delimiting each category is restricted. This note starts the investigation of such models. We specifically study the case of models using one or two profiles together with an outranking relation based on unanimity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The present research aims to propose a Supplier Selection Model that creates collaborative relationships in Supply Chains, so that suppliers can be previously categorized into the cooperation, the coordination and the collaboration levels. Applied, quantitative, exploratory and descriptive research methods were used. A bibliographical research, a questionnaire, and the quantitative modeling were adopted as methodological procedures. The managers responsible for the Supplier Selection process in the Brazilian Wind Energy companies participated in this research. First, a criteria framework for the Selection of Supplier of goods and services was developed. Second, a Multicriteria Decision Aiding Model was created and validated, enabling the classification of the suppliers according to the relationship levels in a systematic way in terms of their performance from a set of criteria by implementing the ELECTRE TRI method. Firms can use the Model periodically in order to revise the supplier assessment and, if needed, direct them to either an inferior or superior class. © 2021 Brazilian Operations Research Society.},

abstract={In this paper we describe and apply a new model for evaluating the quality of services provided by an airport, considering the customers perceptions about the services. The proposal is based on adapting and applying a multicriteria and multiple evaluators outranking algorithm to a dataset collected in a survey filled by 1935 customers that evaluated the International Airport Antonio Carlos Jobim (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Results shown a positive perception about the services supplied by the airport. The main contribution is the proposal of a model that applies a fully non-compensatory algorithm, and without the need to convert qualitative evaluations into numerical values, and allows each customer to adopt his own set of criteria. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper presents an algorithm that can elicitate (infer) all or any combination of elimination and choice expressing reality (ELECTRE) Tri-B parameters. For example, a decision maker can maintain the values for indifference, preference and veto thresholds, and the study’s algorithm can find the criteria weights, reference profiles and the lambda cutting level. The study’s approach is inspired by a machine learning ensemble technique, the random forest, and for that, the authors named the study’s approach as ELECTRE tree algorithm. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors generate a set of ELECTRE Tri-B models, where each model solves a random sample of criteria and alternates. Each sample is made with replacement, having at least two criteria and between 10% and 25% of alternates. Each model has its parameters optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) that can use an ordered cluster or an assignment example as a reference to the optimization. Finally, after the optimization phase, two procedures can be performed; the first one will merge all models, finding in this way the elicitated parameters and in the second procedure, each alternate is classified (voted) by each separated model, and the majority vote decides the final class. Findings: The authors have noted that concerning the voting procedure, nonlinear decision boundaries are generated and they can be suitable in analyzing problems of the same nature. In contrast, the merged model generates linear decision boundaries. Originality/value: The elicitation of ELECTRE Tri-B parameters is made by an ensemble technique that is composed of a set of multicriteria models that are engaged in generating robust solutions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={To satisfy their main goal, namely providing quality water to consumers, water distribution networks (WDNs) need to be suitably monitored. Only well designed and reliable monitoring data enables WDN managers to make sound decisions on their systems. In this belief, water utilities worldwide have invested in monitoring and data acquisition systems. However, good monitoring needs optimal sensor placement and presents a multi-objective problem where cost and quality are conflicting objectives (among others). In this paper, we address the solution to this multi-objective problem by integrating quality simulations using EPANET-MSX, with two optimization techniques. First, multi-objective optimization is used to build a Pareto front of non-dominated solutions relating contamination detection time and detection probability with cost. To assist decision makers with the selection of an optimal solution that provides the best trade-off for their utility, a multi-criteria decision-making technique is then used with a twofold objective: 1) to cluster Pareto solutions according to network sensitivity and entropy as evaluation parameters; and 2) to rank the solutions within each cluster to provide deeper insight into the problem when considering the utility perspectives.The clustering process, which considers features related to water utility needs and available information, helps decision makers select reliable and useful solutions from the Pareto front. Thus, while several works on sensor placement stop at multi-objective optimization, this work goes a step further and provides a reduced and simplified Pareto front where optimal solutions are highlighted. The proposed methodology uses the NSGA-II algorithm to solve the optimization problem, and clustering is performed through ELECTRE TRI. The developed methodology is applied to a very well-known benchmarking WDN, for which the usefulness of the approach is shown. The final results, which correspond to four optimal solution clusters, are useful for decision makers during the planning and development of projects on networks of quality sensors. The obtained clusters exhibit distinctive features, opening ways for a final project to prioritize the most convenient solution, with the assurance of implementing a Pareto-optimal solution. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={As the European Union wants to lead the clean energy transition, it has proposed ambitious targets for energy efficiency improvement. The target established for 2020 on energy efficiency of 20% will unlikely be achieved, and the goal for 2030 has increased to 32.5%. In order to guarantee the planned goals, governments need to strengthen their current governance frameworks. Nevertheless, so far, there has been a lack of literature that suggests a sound methodological approach for performing governance capacity evaluation. For this reason, this paper aims at building a Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding model to assess the current governance capacities on energy efficiency of the 28 Member States of the European Union. Our study explores the accomplishments in terms of energy efficiency governance through the ELECTRE TRI-nC method. After gathering all data and running the model, each country was classified according to its current governance efforts on energy efficiency. The analysis of the results shows room for improvement in terms of compliance with the European regulation by Member States, as well as the need to make the current governance framework more severe in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Patients with advanced hip osteoarthritis are likely to suffer from biomechanical disorders. As many criteria inform how such patients are being qualified for alloplasty procedures, this article proposes a multi-criteria decisional framework in qualifying patients for treatment while undergoing diagnostic analysis for hip replacement surgery. In order to assess the patient's health condition, the competence of physicians and physiotherapists must first be checked. After creating the expert preference model and decision tree, the AHP method was applied followed by the Electre Tri method in the next stage of verification. Integrating these analytic procedures, a group of patients can be quickly evaluated and meaningfully profiled. Specifically, these patients can be classified in respect of their condition determined during hospitalisation as per the severity of degenerative disease and on the basis of their subjective feelings and diagnostics. The proposed methodology promises to allow optimal treatment to be assigned while enabling the appropriate classification and verification within group of patients targeted for hip replacement surgery. © 2020 IGI Global.

abstract={Deficient maintenance management of water distribution systems is an issue in many countries around the world. In northeast Brazil, losses of water during its distribution has reached 42.7 %. Maintenance planning is essential to improve efficiency in a water distribution system. Therefore, a framework was proposed that combines Strategic Options Development and Analysis (SODA) with the ELECTRE TRI-nC method to sort areas into criticality categories in order to determine priorities for monitoring a maintenance service. To provide a global characterization, three categories are recognized: “Not critical,” “Moderately critical,” and “Highly critical.” The proposed framework is applied in a real case study of a municipality located in the northeast of Brazil (Itamaracá/Pernambuco). This framework provides (i) managerial priorities to support maintenance decisions that improve the action planning of the water company, (ii) formal and structured knowledge about the water distribution system, and (iii) benefits to society, such as improving the quality of service, reducing costs, and preserving water resources. Our study demonstrates that actions such as developing awareness -raising campaigns about the rational use of water, installing pressure and flow control valves and establishing sectorization in the network system are essential in order to improve how maintenance is managed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The challenge of promoting sustainable cities and reaching the objectives developed by the European Green Deal includes the renovation of the building sector, as it is responsible for 40% of energy consumption in Europe. Regional or local public administrations have to allocate their financial resources for improving the energy performances of their building stock and to face a multidimensional problem, where different aspects – such as energy efficiency, financial-economic feasibility and environmental protection – have to be harmonized. The present study proposes a Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding model, which includes the ELECTRE TRI-nC method, for supporting the public decision process of sorting alternative energy retrofitting actions into various categories, each of them expresses different levels of overall performance. The model is applied to an Italian real case study. An experts’ panel has been involved for structuring the decision problem and discussing the results. The results show that opaque envelope insulation actions are often classified in best categories to be implemented and funded instead the upgrade of the lighting system falls in the worst category. These results are useful for local or regional public administrations to select those energy retrofitting actions that have to be financed as a priority. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This work deals with the sorting of the suitability of the roofs for the integration of PV systems, implementable as a GIS (Geographical Information System). Such sorting can provide relevant information to help and guide urban actors further develop solar energy, and therefore contribute to the acceleration of the deployment of this source of energy in cities. Three scenarios of sorting are considered: the energetic, the economic and the multicriteria sorting. The energetic and economic sorting scenarios are actually similar to the great majority of the currently proposed sorting in publicly available solar GIS tools (solar cadastre), which consider only one attribute such as the solar irradiation or the payback period. Knowing the limits of these sorting scenarios, a multicriteria approach is adopted and takes into account more impactful attributes in the urban actors’ choices. The ELECTRE TRI methodology is used for this sorting problem. Different decisional criteria related to energy, economy, historic buildings and heritage, the structure and superstructure states of the roof are identified and detailed. The method is then applied to a set of alternatives (roofs) in a district of Geneva. The sorting results show that the proposed multicriteria scenario better integrates the complexity of the urban environment and provides a more relevant information regarding the suitability of the roofs for PV integration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We present two new interval-based extensions of ELECTRE TRI-nB and ELECTRE TRI-nC, in which the preference relations are built by using the interval outranking approach. The boundaries between adjacent classes (or categories) are described by a set of limiting profiles, whose criteria could take on values which are interval numbers. Compared to INTERCLASS (a recently proposed interval-based ordinal classification method), the assignments suggested by our first extension come from enhanced preference relations between the actions and limiting boundaries and are likely to be more appropriate. In addition, it can suggest assignments from a pseudo-conjunctive logic. In our second extension, each class is characterized by a set of representative actions, again allowing interval numbers as criterion scores. The outranking relations between actions and classes are enhanced by having several representative actions in each category. Both new extensions can handle imperfect knowledge of the model parameters (weights, veto thresholds, credibility threshold), even missing criterion scores. Some fundamental properties and results are proved to guarantee the consistency of the methods, which are also illustrated with some numerical examples. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Inadequate construction and demolition waste disposal create severe environmental impacts in cities when it occurs in an uncontrolled manner. For waste with the possibility of recycling, the appropriate destination would be recycling plants or landfills. In the investigative process, no studies were found that considered the sorting procedure by compensatory and non-compensatory multi-criteria analysis integrated to the Geographic Information System to choose suitable landfills or recycling plants in cities. This study aims to fill this gap with a structured methodology for mapping suitable sites to receive inert waste from small and medium cities. For this, it was considered the identification of relevant criteria and weights definition by Analytic Hierarchy Process method and after performing a sorting procedure by ArcGIS 10.0 software (compensatory aspect) and ELECTRE TRI method (non-compensatory aspect). And then, an aggregate analysis in order to support the decision-making was also developed. An experimental study was carried out with the application of this methodology in a city of the south western of Parana, Brazil, allowing the analysis of criteria such as land use, soil type and slope, as well as distances to urban area, education and health institutions, roads and highways and hydrography network. We combined these data in a multi-criteria analysis to provide an aptitude mapping to identify suitable landfill areas with 5 km2, and sorted as low, medium and high aptitude classes by ArcGIS software and ELECTRE TRI method. With all that, it shows to be efficient, providing relevant practical and theoretical implications to this theme. © 2020},

abstract={This study presents the potential of multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) as a tool for prediction analysis. We apply MCDA methodology for the determination of internal migration potential of regions within a country. The ELECTRE Tri-C together with the Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process (MCHP), the imprecise SRF method and the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) will be applied to investigate the case of the internal migrations in Serbia. We shall give recommendations regarding the migration potential of Serbian municipalities in the following years. In particular, the ELECTRE Tri-C will be applied to classify the regions in four classes ordered with respect to regions’ migration potential, MCHP will be used to take into account the hierarchical structure of criteria on which the municipalities are evaluated. Finally, the imprecise SRF method, as well as the SMAA methodology, will be used to take into account the preferences of numerous economic agents. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Energy Efficiency (EE) has been identified as one of the most cost-effective means aiming at reducing energy consumption while maintaining an equivalent level of economic activity. Mainstreaming EE financing is considered a key priority to avert climate change. The lack of evidence on the performance, commonly agreed procedures and standards for EE investments, particularly during the first stages of investment generation and pre-selection/pre-evaluation, are the key problems hampering EE investment financing. It is also true that often project developers do not have the expertise or resources to make a convincing financing case for investors. In order to boost EE investments, this paper proposes a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methodology intending to support financing institutions to identify attractive EE project ideas in the early development phase of project initiation and planning. The study implements the ELECTRE TRI method to benchmark EE project ideas in a standardized, investor recognizable credit rating form. A respective web-based tool facilitating the methodology and the screening of EE projects is also developed, supporting financing bodies and EE funds to rapidly detect and aggregate projects that meet the necessary criteria to be financed. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: Business Process Management is a systematic way to design, implement and manage business critical processes at different organizational levels to ensure business sustainability. In this paper, we conduct a business process re-engineering exercise for KBK Securities Co., a small size security company operating in Iranian stock and mercantile market. The company suffered from in-efficiencies and poor and delayed decision-making due to poor visibility and complexity with business critical processes. Design: We employed a semi-quantitative approach using ELECTRE TRI decision-making method to identify the business critical processes. Through document analysis, we identified 103 financial and stock market processes to streamlining purposes. We use Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) and ELECTRE TRI methods for first, arriving to a consensus for the imprecise information elicited from a group of departmental managers, and second making a decision-making to determine the 32 business critical processes out of 103, and third clustering these processes for business process re-engineering. We make significant contribution in theory by employing a multi criterion decision-making (MCDM) in the financial sector in the context of a developing economy like Iran. Originality: We provide a structured framework along with an off the shelf software tool for practitioners to implement this approach to rationalize the number of processes and subsequently to improve the business critical processes to enhance financial performance in the stock market. Findings: Our findings suggest that company can cut down approximately 68% waste by reducing its business critical processes and spend their available time and resources in growing the business. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={With the advancement in autonomic computing technology, quality assurance for autonomic software is another big challenge to be faced by IT industries. Autonomic software is quite different in working compared to non-autonomic software. So, quality estimation parameters will also be different. Quality assurance method for autonomic software has not been standardized yet but quality parameters based on autonomic features have been suggested by researchers. Based on the functioning of autonomic software and autonomic capabilities, Autonomicity and Trustworthiness are considered to be the major quality estimation metrics. In this paper, trustworthiness estimation is performed using six attributes. To contribute in this area further, attributes are ranked based on the weights estimated using Electre-Tri multi-criteria outranking method. The attributes weights can be used further to estimate trustworthiness for any autonomic software. With this, the quality estimation task can also be processed for autonomic software. © 2020, © 2020 Taru Publications.},

abstract={The evaluation of multidimensional risk in natural gas pipelines is a topic of interest due to the possibility of human, environmental, and financial losses occurring. However, managing risks in pipeline systems might be a complex task due to the uncertainty inherent in the parameters of the model, being a factor that managers must take account. This requires more regular effort to be made to maintain safety conditions at stable levels, and for it to be borne in mind that pipeline sections at risk may be sensitive to both minor and major changes. Thus, this study undertakes a global sensitivity analysis based on a multidimensional assessment of risk, which uses ELECTRE TRI integrated into the Utility Theory approach, in order to classify sections of a natural gas pipeline into risk categories. For this analysis, parameters are set for operational, physical, and failure modes for different pipeline sections. The assessment is formulated to include preferences, graphical information and consequence modeling. Then, simulations are run to provide the decision-maker with relevant information, based on different settings of groups of parameters. From a graphical analysis appraisal, this paper gives the notion to the decision maker of sensitivity levels of each section and how sections are changing regarding their original risk class based on the variations tested. Thus, it is shown that, with the aid of procedures that evaluate risk under uncertainty, actions can be determined that lead to resources being applied better and more efficiently so as to guarantee acceptable safety levels for everyone and everything involved in a natural gas transportation system, thereby avoiding human, environmental, financial and company losses. © ESREL 2020-PSAM15 Organizers.Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.},

abstract={Ethereum smart contract system has seen a steady adoption as it continues to support tens of thousands of contracts. This feature has evolved to give a practical shape to the ideas leading up to fractional ownership transfer, using advanced smart contracts such as ERC-981. However, alongside its numerous benefits, various risks arise with the actual implementation of the ERC-981. This paper documents high-level processes and risk factors involved in the transfer-system, building a theoretical risk model based on Electre Tri-framework belonging to MCDA classification/sorting models. This model deals with detecting problems that are pre-defined on a central reference. The approach is illustrated through several stages: following comparison between the methods of risk analysis towards a risk assessment model, proposing recommendations and solutions. The framework was able to detect 18 major risks and bugs assigned to 6 categories. © 2020 ASTES Publishers. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Saving energy in MANET represents a critical issue due to its material architecture. This paper aims to improve ad-hoc on-demand multipath distance vector routing (AOMDV) using multicriteria analysis method. In order to construct effective disjoints paths, our approach focuses on sorting the different available paths considering several important criteria. Our objective is improving the network performances and routing stability using an efficient multicriteria method called Electre Tri. The use of this technique enhances data reach ability and minimises the required delay during packets forwarding. The proposed approach is evaluated comparatively to well known routing protocols considering various metrics. Simulation results prove that our approach improves significantly the network lifetime and the transmission delay. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Road accidents have become a major social and health problem for being dramatically increasing day after day worldwide. Scientists are conducting their studies to define the main attributes that share the severity of road accidents. Finding a new approach to analyze road accidents is of great urgency. Data mining techniques are best fitting to discover useful information out of enormous data which are used to make proactive decisions. Methods: This paper tempts a rule-based machine learning method known as association rule mining, which can identify strong rules discovered in databases using interesting measures. Given a da-ta-set from the Lebanese territory for the years 2016-2017, the application of association rule mining, the Apriori method takes its place. However, its implementation leads to a very large number of rules. The task that is the most difficult is extracting meaningful and non-redundant rules. In order to find out the most interesting and relevant rules out of fatal rules such, ELECTRE TRI and PROME-THEE methods, the most significant methods of decision making, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) are integrated to resolve the outranking problem. The integration is presented by the use of the same set of weights and the same constant values of Indifference and Preference thresholds used in ELECTRE-TRI method to define the linear preference function needed by PROMETHEE method. Realizing the sensitivity of the final output of alternatives ranking to the changes of the input parameters of the decision-making tool, this proposed integration helps the decision makers to overcome their ambivalence between preference and indifference thresholds and to cope adequately with the issue of the uncertainty of MCDA procedures; it comes up with the complete ranking of rules. Results: The obtained ranked rules declare the most significant attributes or combinations of attributes that influence the severity of road accidents. Four main factors of fatal road accidents are pinpointed: over-speeding mainly leading up to rollover crashes, pedestrians encountering in the context, distracted driving leading to fatal road vehicle collisions with Pedestrian victims; and wet roads particularly in the case of single car accidents. Meanwhile, the importance of ELECRE-TRI and PROMETHEE and their integration in dealing with such complex phenomena and corresponding database with a large number of involved attributes have been validated. Conclusion: This paper studies the phenomenon of road accidents. Association rule mining has been applied to discover all possible relations between the various attributes. The integration of ELEC-TRE-TRI and PROMETHEE MCDA techniques aims at extracting meaningful information from the big dataset. The obtained results have shown how influencing the behavior of the driver is on the occurrence of fatal road accidents. These findings contribute to supporting decision makers to draw new design conceptions for road infrastructure and develop preventive measures that improve road safety in Lebanon. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={The major challenge for agriculture today is to reduce the pesticide use while maintaining a satisfactory level of yield, quality and profitability. As part of a research project, we studied the use of pesticides in the wine region of Bordeaux. We evaluated the performance of existing viticultural systems and proposed scenarios for changing practices to reduce the reliance on pesticides. We surveyed 39 winegrowers adopting different crop practices. We evaluated the systems using multi-criteria decision aid methods: ELECTRE Tri-C and ELECTRE III. We selected seven criteria of evaluation for socioeconomic performance (economic profitability, workload, and complexity of the system) and environmental performance (pesticide pressure, ecotoxicity of pesticides, agro-ecological practices, pesticide drift). We built three scenarios for changing practices including the best practices identified in the field: the first one optimizes conventional practices (Maximized-conventional system); the two others adopt an agroecological approach: Agroecological system (with optimized use of synthetic chemicals) and Agroecology-organic system (without synthetic chemicals). ELECTRE Tri-C sorted the existing systems and the three scenarios into one of the four pre-defined categories of performance. Then ELECTRE III classified them in each category. Organic systems as well as agroecological scenarios were assigned into high-level performances. This result can be explained by the high level of profitability and the low level of pesticide pressure in these systems associated to practices that enhance biodiversity in the vineyard. These results, based on realistic approaches, are adaptable models for conventional agriculture. © N. Aouadi et al., Hosted by EDP Sciences 2020.},

abstract={A multicriteria methodology for estimating consumer acceptance of vehicles with alternative powertrain technologies is presented. The approach is based on the non-compensatory ELECTRE TRI method and compares hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles to conventional models. Criteria considered are ownership costs and restrictions to vehicle use, which apply mainly to electric vehicles. The methodology is applied to a case study of 94 vehicles of different market segments and alternative powertrains. The analysis is carried out per segment and considers two driver profiles, city and all-purpose, and a baseline scenario for all cases. Output is tested for statistical significance, with powertrain technology as disaggregating factor, and a sensitivity analysis on the base scenario is also carried out, as well as a comparison with results derived by a compensatory multicriteria method (TOPSIS). Results show that conventional vehicles are the top choice for the small vehicles segment, due to lower purchase prices and higher use flexibility. For medium sized vehicles, all powertrain technologies are competitive for city drivers, whereas for all-purpose drivers, use restrictions for electric vehicles make these less attractive. The baseline scenario and sensitivity analysis highlight that opting for an electric vehicle depends strongly on the driver's use flexibility needs. As such, an electric vehicle can be either very attractive or outright unusable, regardless of financial considerations. It is also seen that plug-in hybrids do not present any significant advantage, as compared to other, non-electric choices, due to their higher purchase prices. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In recent years, the partnerships between private companies and public organizations are becoming key elements for improving local development, territorial competitiveness, and delivering innovation. These collaborations are widely promoted by the European Framework Programme for Research and Innovation thanks to the provision of several instruments, such as Horizon 2020. In this context, competitiveness’s improvement of the territory employing research and innovation actions is supported by the technological districts. In Sicily, the AgroBioPesca district has attempted a strategic action named “Call for ideas” in order to design its own roadmap for research and innovation in the agri-food sector. For this purpose, many proponents of public and/or private sectors presented several innovative project ideas referred to specific Technological Trajectories. This paper aims at providing an instrument able to select the most suitable project ideas in order to constitute the AgroBioPesca projects portfolio. To such an aim, the authors propose the application of the multiple criteria sorting method ELECTRE TRI considering criteria deduced by the Horizon 2020 guidelines and documents. The application of this methodology allows subdividing the project ideas received into project ideas to be rejected, reviewable, and eligible for funding. Moreover, to consider the uncertainty of the decision-makers’ judgment, the authors propose a new version of the method in which the crisp judgment is converted into an interval. A sensitivity analysis has lastly been conducted to study the weaknesses of non-financiable projects. © 2019 Editora Mundos Sociais. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper describes an original proposal for modeling the evaluation the Quality of Services (QOS) provided by libraries under the view point of multiple evaluators that take into account multiple criteria. The research was based in applying ELECTRE TRI ME for evaluating the quality of services provided by a library devote to nuclear studies in Brazil. The ELECTRE ME avoids the contradictory approach of using of compensatory algorithms (such as weighted mean) as an input in non-compensatory outranking methods, despite the non-compensatory principle is in the heart of the ELECTRE methods. It was not found a previous proposal with that incorporate outranking concepts in situations where more than one evaluator is present, and, to apply it to evaluate the quality of the services provided by a library. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={Smart PSS (product-service system) has been transcending the scope of traditional PSS through ICTs (information and communication technologies). The co-implementation is a specific way of co-creation to generate value for customer and supplier in smart PSS. Meanwhile, the service failures in co-implementation can bring about service paradox. As such, three key research questions, including the construction of co-implementation of smart PSS, the extension of risk factors in FMECA and the category of identified failure modes, are put forward and conquered by a proposed methodological framework. First, in order to construct the co-implementation of smart PSS involving customer and supplier, the PCN (process-chain-network) diagram with direct interaction, surrogate interaction and independent handling is employed to reflect the nature of interaction. Second, since that the highly complexity of co-implementation of smart PSS can lead to more huge risk, an extended-FMECA (failure mode effect and criticality analysis) sheet is formulated by considering the adaptation of autonomy. Third, to handle the uncertainty of expert judgments more reasonably and determine the weights of risk factors without additional information, a hybrid approach integrating rough-entropy-ELECTRE TRI is proposed to classify failure modes into ordinal classes, so that decision-makers can swiftly access them. This proposed methodological framework also is illustrated by the co-implementation of smart fridge-service system, in which the feasibility and superiority are verified by analysing comparative results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Efficiency and effectiveness of logistic activities, in general, and of distribution networks, in particular, are largely influenced by the way warehouses operate as nodes of these networks. In recent years, warehouse management has undergone major changes due to the increase of e-commerce and competition in time-reduction. Despite that, logistic costs of warehouse processes (e.g. receiving, storage, order picking and shipping, etc.) are still often high. Referring to the order picking process, related activities may be optimized by a proper assignment of products to storage locations. In the literature, this problem is known as Storage Location Assignment Problem (SLAP). Due to the multi-criteria nature of SLAP, a combined ELECTRE TRI and TOPSIS based approach under an uncertain environment is designed in the present paper. Aiming at properly dealing with the uncertainty of the decision process, an interval extension of both ELECTRE TRI and TOPSIS is proposed. Therefore, ELECTRE TRI is firstly used to assign products to shelf levels whereas TOPSIS is afterwards applied to determine their storage locations within every level rather than using a random assignment policy. The whole methodology has been designed in cooperation with a Sicilian company that provides logistic services all over the Italian territory. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We consider the problem of learning a function assigning objects into ordered categories. The objects are described by a vector of attribute values and the assignment function is monotone w.r.t. the attribute values (monotone sorting problem). Our approach is based on a model used in multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), called MR-Sort. This model determines the assigned class on the basis of a majority rule and an artificial object that is a typical lower profile of the category. MR-Sort is a simplified variant of the ELECTRE TRI method. We describe an algorithm designed for learning such a model on the basis of assignment examples. We compare its performance with choquistic regression, a method recently proposed in the preference learning community, and with UTADIS, another MCDA method leaning on an additive value function (utility) model. Our experimentation shows that MR-Sort competes with the other two methods, and leads to a model that is interpretable. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={In the 2010 Toronto summit, the leaders of the G-20 countries agreed on the implementation of urgent fiscal consolidation plans, following the expansionary policies adopted to curb the recessionary effects of the financial crisis. Unprecedented cuts in public expenditures have taken place, particularly in the European Union periphery, reviving the discussion on the optimal size of the public sector. Supporters of fiscal restraint defend that bigger governments tend to be more inefficient, its opponents assume that government size determines the effectiveness of its performance. However, the social and economic impacts from contractionary fiscal policies ultimately depend on the level of public sector efficiency. Relatively inefficient governments have more scope to consolidate without compromising social welfare. In this paper, we adopt a multiple decision aiding approach, not previously employed for the assessment of complex macroeconomic performances, and employ the ELECTRE TRI-C outranking method to categorize OECD countries on a set of criteria representing the quality of their public sectors. We then compare the obtained classifications with the share of each government's expenditures on GDP, to identify distinct levels of efficiency. Our analysis suggests that various countries exhibit a margin for efficiency gains, attenuating the social and economic effects of fiscal consolidation policies. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={The goal of this paper is to build an operational model for assessing creditworthiness of innovative small and medium-sized enterprises. To this purpose, a novel multicriteria methodology is implemented through a simulation approach within the context of the ELECTRE TRI-based framework. The model is applied to a database, retained from AIDA, involving a sample of Italian innovative small and medium-sized enterprises. The main finding is twofold. From a theoretical point of view, the credit rating model proposed allows to incorporate an override in the credit class, as required by Basel II in all the cases in which the availability of data is insufficient to describe the risk factors or a judgmental rating model is advised, as well as in innovative small and medium-sized enterprises. From an operational point of view, this methodology could be a useful tool for banks’ innovative lending processes, because of the lack of a credit model in this context. © 2017, © 2017 Operational Research Society.},

abstract={With the expansion in the quantity of cell phone utilization, mobile applications are developing significantly in today’s high-tech environment. With this high demand, the quality of mobile applications is turning into a major issue. The organizations are still finding a way to develop quality applications. The number of quality models has already been proposed for assessing the quality of a mobile application but none of them provide a holistic view towards quality assurance. The present research work proposes an empirical evaluation of the SQM-MApp quality model using a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making approach named ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELimination and Choice Expressing REality) (ELECTRE-TRI) method and step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method for ranking and determining weights of chosen quality factors respectively. The proposed approach specifically is for the mobile applications that are from the gaming domain.

abstract={Selection of a retail location is a strategic decision-making problem that involves the long-term commitment of resources. However, very often managers look for several candidate locations that can be incorporated in a business plan. In this article, a case study developed in a large Brazilian company is presented where managers required to identify a set of interesting locations in a context of imprecise and qualitative information. ELECTRE TRI-C is applied, a multi-criteria decision analysis sorting method in which representative reference alternatives are used to model preference ordered categories, a priori. Trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TrFNs) are used as input in ELECTRE TRI-C, which allows: (1) imprecision and uncertainty parameters to be set in a very transparent way; (2) in the case of qualitative criteria, to define a category by providing information about reference alternatives in the form of the membership degree of verbal values, a feature that was not available so far in this method; (3) the outranking indices to be calculated such that the rationale of assignment rules is preserved; (4) the proliferation of fuzzy numbers to evaluate alternatives to be avoided, thus reducing the cognitive effort of the decision maker. TrFNs obtained in a previous analysis are used in the case study, thereby showing the advantages of the approach. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In the present study, the authors propose a group decision support system (Web-GDSS), which allows multi-agents systems and multicriteria analysis systems to help decision-makers in order to obtain a collective decision, using web services. The proposed system operates on two main stages. First, decision-makers are in a different location away from each other. They must store their location in databases and invoke the appropriate web service. Second, in the case of negotiation between decision-makers, monotonic concession protocol will lead to an agreement using CONDORCET and BORDA voting methods. © 2019, IGI Global.

abstract={Indirect approaches for eliciting preference model parameters for multiple criteria decision aiding are of growing interest because they imply relatively less cognitive effort from the decision-maker (DM). Direct approaches are particularly hard in the case of the new ELECTRE TRI-nB method, because the task involves eliciting a number of limiting profiles for each category boundary. However, in ELECTRE methods, the simultaneous inference of the whole set of parameters needs the construction and resolution of a non-linear non-convex programming problem, which is typically very hard to solve. Therefore, an evolutionary-based method to infer the parameters of the ELECTRE TRI-nB model is proposed in this paper. The quality of the solutions is tested by measuring the capacity to restore the assignment examples and the capacity to make consistent assignments of new actions. In extensive computer experiments, using the pseudo-conjunctive assignment procedure, some main conclusions arise: (i) the capacity of the method to restore the training examples reaches high values, mainly with three and five limiting profiles per category; and (ii) the capacity to make appropriate assignments of new actions (not belonging to the training information) can be greatly improved by increasing the number of limiting profiles. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents a new outranking method whose main feature is its capacity to handle imperfect knowledge. This research is interested in two important sources of imperfect knowledge: 1) poorly known model parameters, and 2) imperfectly known (even missing) criterion values characterizing the actions. The use of interval numbers to model imperfect knowledge is suggested, and a new interval-based outranking method is proposed as an extension of the outranking approach to the interval framework. This method handles different sources of imperfect knowledge coming from model parameters (weights, veto thresholds, majority threshold) and from ill-determined, imprecise, uncertain, arbitrary (even missing) criterion values. The index of likelihood of the interval outranking is interpreted from a logical perspective, and could be used for choice, ranking and ordinal classification. Specifically, this paper proposes the method INTERCLASS for ordinal classification, which is inspired by ELECTRE TRI-B. Their assignment rules and structural properties are similar, but INTERCLASS is able to handle imprecisions in weights, veto thresholds, cutting level, and even in criteria defining limiting profiles. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Irrigated agriculture has considerable impacts on the environment. To minimize negative effects and maximize positive effects, it is necessary to provide comprehensive analyses beyond the strictly technical domain. In this study, we apply a methodology for determining priorities in implementing irrigation plans using multi-criteria analysis methods on a specific case study area in the sub-catchment area of the Orljava River in Požega-Slavonia County, Croatia. Five potential irrigation areas (Orljava-Londža, Pleternica, Ovčare, Treštanovci, and Venje-Hrnjevac) were analyzed according to five selected criteria: environmental protection, water-related (four sub-criteria), social, economic, and time criteria with different criteria importance (weight). The aim of this study was to confirm the adequacy of using six multi-criteria analysis (MCA) methods (mostly used: PROMETHEE, AHP, ELECTRE TRI, and the less used: DEXi, PRIME, and PCA) in determining priorities for fulfilling irrigation plans, present models for preparation of the input data, apply certain methods, and compare the results on the selected case study area. The methods' adequacy was confirmed during the research. Five of the six MCA methods identified the Ovčare area as the most appropriate for irrigation development (i.e., it has priority in implementing the irrigation plan). According to one (AHP) of the six methods, Orljava-Londža has more advantages over other areas. All MCA methods, except PCA, chose Venje-Hrnjevac as the least advisable (last to be implemented) alternative. Conclusions from this research confirm findings from recently published research regarding the application of MCA on water management problems. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Priori ELECTRE TRI is a multi-criteria sorting method which places the existing alternatives in a series of predefined categories. Each category is known by two profiles that delineate the upper and lower limits of the category, and for every criterion, these profiles have a predefined value. In this paper, the ELECTRE TRI method is considered in the state of posteriori, in which, the expert first assigns the existing alternatives to the categories, and after that the value of each profile for each criterion is determined. The aim of this study is finding profiles in which all the other parameters (thresholds and cutting levels) are pre-defined. To determine the value of each criterion for each profile, a new mixed-integer nonlinear programming model (MINLP) is proposed whose objective is to maximize the lowest credibility for every profile relative to the alternatives assigned to the categories. Due to the complexity of the problem, a heuristic method and a particle swarm optimization meta-heuristic are proposed to solve the problem. Some instances of FINRISK.BDF from ELECTRE TRI software are studied to compare and evaluate the proposed methods. According to the computational experiments, the particle swarm optimization algorithm outperforms the heuristic method and can be used to solve large-scale problems effectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The main objective of this paper is to balance social, environmental and economic criteria, alongside related ethical issues, in the supplier selection process when outsourcing activities in the textile industry. We propose a multi-criteria model to support supplier selection process, whereby suppliers are allocated to classes based on sustainability, integrating the opinions of customers and managers. The model has three phases: i) criteria definition, in which the Copeland method is used to aggregate criteria reported in the literature for a group of decision makers (customers and expert managers); ii) elicitation of the perceptions of decision-makers, about criteria and the definition of weights for these criteria using the AHP method, and iii) multi-criteria classification of suppliers performed using the ELECTRE-TRI method. A numerical application was performed in the textile sector in order to test results. The main results show that suppliers can be classified, balancing social, environmental and economic criteria and related ethical issues, considering opinions from customers and experts. The theoretical implications can benefit researchers who can apply the model in future research into economic, environmental and social interactions. Managers can use the structure presented in this model to improve supplier selection. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Decision and planning problems are often informed by the preferences of the actors involved. This chapter aims at explaining what ‘elicitation of preferences’ means for different decision support methodologies. Three elicitation approaches are presented: multicriteria decision analysis, conjoint analysis, and problem structuring methods. The potential of these approaches for structuring and supporting energy-related decisions is illustrated through several applications, namely, the assessment of initiatives to promote energy efficiency through soft systems methodology and ELECTRE, the evaluation of policies to foster the development of smart grids using the Delphi method and ELECTRE TRI, and the modelling of consumer preferences for electric vehicles using choice-based conjoint analysis. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={ELECTRE TRI, a family of multi-criteria methods used to sort alternatives into preference-ordered categories, defines an outranking function to measure the membership degree of an alternative to a category, whenever imprecise evaluations are available. Recent extensions use Hesitant Fuzzy Sets (HFS) to consider uncertain evaluations. However, deterministic parameters are considered, which avoids the application to cases in which non-fuzzy scores and unstable parameters are available. In this study, an approach is proposed for: 1) modeling hesitant outranking functions originated from unstable parameters provided by several DMs; 2) using the HFS to calculate the ELECTRE TRI-C indices; 3) reducing the DMs cognitive effort when they are asked to provide information. An application to supplier development is presented by using ELECTRE TRI-C. Results are compared by using different HFS aggregation operators and sensitivity analysis shows that a robust conclusion can be obtained. Future lines of research are also suggested. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this work, we have developed the first version of a smartness assessment framework that allows the representatives from a village to make a self-evaluation of its current status based on smartness criteria identified by an international group of experts. The framework allows a detailed evaluation of six different aspects including Mobility, Governance, Economy, Environment, Living, People, with weightings of the criteria using the multi-criteria analysis Electre Tri. In addition, the results enable further data analysis and offers an input for different functionality like identification of best practices and collaboration and matchmaking among potential stakeholders. In addition, we show the effectiveness of the proposed framework by means of a case study on a test area around the European Alpine space. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

With the increased demand of Mobile applications users, the quality of the mobile applications becomes a major concern. The number of studies shows issues while the usability of mobile applications and proposed various methods for its evaluation. But none of the models proposed gives a holistic way for assessing the usability of mobile applications. For this, one needs to first identify the factors on which usability depends and then evaluate it. The paper, discuss the key concept of usability of mobile applications and proposes 11 usability critical factors for the measurement of usability. These factors are evaluated and prioritized based on ELECTRE-TRI outranking method, a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis approach. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={With the increase in the number of smartphones, the use of mobile applications is growing dramatically in today's high-tech environment. With this high user demand, the quality of mobile applications is becoming a serious issue. With the perspective of quality enhancement, these applications must be smart enough so that they can handle any kind of issue automatically. Also, with the increasing complexity of these applications, they need to be more self-managed for better operability and interoperability. The self-management features allow handling issues such as error handling, optimization, resource utilization, configuration management etc. by its own. This will lead to the better functionality of mobile applications. The present research work proposes to incorporate autonomic capability as an attribute for assessing mobile applications. A multi-criteria decision-making approach named ELECTRE-TRI outranking method is used to evaluate the self-management aspect i.e. the autonomic capability of mobile applications to provide the quality estimation of mobile applications a better way. © 2019, IGI Global.},

abstract={Regulatory governance is considered as a new era in the state's intervention, and it is vital to foster both qualitative and quantitative performances of regulators. In this paper, the authors argue that the absence of governance principles allows regulators to justify the adoption of instruments to improve it. Five core regulatory principles, particularly accountability, administrative capacity, open government, regulatory quality, and rule of law build the bridge between regulatory governance and regulatory substance. The authors propose the application of a multicriteria modelling method (ELECTRE TRI-C) in order to conduct the assessment and categorization of Brazilian subnational regulators according to the presence of governance, encompassing the opinions of legitimate stakeholders. The levels of regulatory governance are calculated for the regulators in order to provide some determinants of good governance, which could be stimulated by regulatory impact assessment, as a policy tool that improves institutional environments. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract={To perform maintenance, the prioritization of sectors on power distribution networks still has been a challenge for managers and maintenance engineers. It should consider relevant aspects of the sectors, such as population density, the number of hospitals, and the number of schools, among others. In order to guarantee facilities reliability, this paper presents a proposal for this problematic by developing a Load Areas-sorting methodology to improve maintenance decisions on power distribution networks. It uses multi-criteria approach; characterizing criteria and weights. The initial phase of the methodology was concerned with defining of relevant operational criteria, suggested by the literature, as well as admitting new criteria that the decision makers may be deemed necessary in each scenario. The main objective was the obtaining comparison parameters to determine critical Load Areas by the occurrence of failures and allocate these areas in priority classes. An application was performed by collecting data from an electric power company in Brazil. For this application, the classes suggested were: High, Medium, and Low priority. Thus, each Load Area was allocated in a priority status regarding its importance to the company and community. The multi-criteria method used in this phase was ELECTRE TRI. With this development, it was possible to know the most critical area equalizing the decision maker’s view and operational indicators. Thus, the maintenance developments can be updated with this methodology, providing sustainability in electricity distribution by adjusted maintenance actions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={Corporate credit ratings are widely used in financial services for risk management, investment, and financing decisions. In this study, the use of a recently developed multicriteria outranking approach, namely the ELECTRE TRI-NC method, is examined for constructing internal credit rating models in an expert-based judgmental framework. The models are constructed in a multicriteria classification (sorting) setting and the results are analyzed in terms of their internal properties as well as their deviations from risk rating categories defined by rating agencies (i.e. external benchmarking). A simulation/scenario analysis is conducted to examine the results and performance of the outranking models in relation to their parameters. Empirical results are provided for a sample of European firms rated by three leading rating agencies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The ideal configuration of wastewater treatment system (WTS) for attending cities specificities has become a complex decision, due to the fact that there are several available technologies, and a diversity of characteristics presented in the scenario of each city. Considering the importance of economic analysis, especially in developing countries, this work aims to demonstrate the economic feasibility considering cost-related indicators for the ideal WTS selection for specific features in these cities. Based on a literature review, 37 main WTS and two economic cost-related indicators (Net Present Value and Annualized Net Present Value) were considered. First of all, using a multicriteria analysis these WTS were grouped in classes using the ELECTRE TRI method, based on criteria related to efficiency, and the weights were defined by appointments from research specialists in the literature appointments. The economic analysis was performed using the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method, which has been applied specifically to each WTS class, thus generating a framework of economic viability for this context. The WTS with low and high costs were appointed, considering the development level in each applied scenario. This work contributes to expanding the WTS study horizons to select an ideal system, considering the economic aspect. © IWA Publishing 2018.},

abstract={Resilience in the context of supply chains has received particular attention over recent years. Companies have been aware of the need to adopt resilience strategies in supply chain management. Therefore, considering resilience factors in the process of assessing and classifying suppliers (ordinal classification or sorting) is relevant. Supplier classification for further selection is a multiple criteria decision problem, which involves several criteria. In this paper, we adopt the ELECTRE TRI-nC method, which allows us to classify the suppliers taking into account multiple criteria and the decision makers’ preferences, including resilience criteria. The method was applied to classify the suppliers of a manufacturing industry from an emerging economy (India). A sorting model was collaboratively constructed through an interaction process between the analysts and the decision makers (industrial managers). The proposed approach contributes to the decision process of selecting suppliers by providing a pre-classification of a set of suppliers into three different categories of overall performance. The results show that the proposed method is suitable and useful as a decision aiding tool for purchasing decisions, allowing managers to obtain robust conclusions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Despite the diversity of advanced approaches, the concept of ‘financial integration’ couldn’t be explicitly analyzed. Indeed, empirical studies have shown that the measures of international financial integration are one-dimensional analysis. Due to the ambiguity of the concept and its multiple determinants, it must be analyzed in multidimensional levels. The interest of this research is a proposal of a decision aid by a multicriteria approach (ELECTRE TRI) for determining the ranking of 47 countries according to the links between their degree of international and financial dependencies and the behavior of financial actors (trying to make governance decisions or diversification strategies of international portfolio).

abstract={An alternative approach to the formal management strategy of tropical timber species from the Congo Basin was investigated. It focused on the development of glulam, with an aim to specify a decision support model for the valorisation of tropical timber species considered for use in these products. There were 76 forest species analysed regarding ecological, engineering and social criteria according to their major uses. The Electre TRI-B multicriteria sorting method was used. The main result was a new and robust classification tool of timber species from the Congo Basin, corresponding to their multicriteria consensus degree. The potentials of the new grouping system were analysed. Species that meet a great majority of criteria were identified. They were highly suitable for sustaining the market position of glulam products. Implementing this strategy may significantly improve the management and increase the value of the timber species from the Congo Basin, while preserving endangered species. © 2018, © 2018 NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

abstract={In an international context that is faced with several environmental issues, especially in relation to energy efficiency, the finding of sustainable solutions for retrofitting existing buildings is a challenging issue. Comprehensive evaluation of the applied materials is required to understand their true impact on the environment as well as their economic suitability. Therefore, a life cycle-based approach is required. This work presents a hybrid method, including energy and comfort optimization, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) analysis, applied for retrofitting a traditional rural building and then combined together in a multi-criteria approach. The case study considers the assessment of the sustainability of several solutions for roof insulation according to seven criteria derived from the hybrid method developed: energy saving, non-renewable energy, comfort performance, global warming, ozone layer depletion, respiratory inorganics and Net Present Value. The multi-criteria approach used to combine these criteria is the Electre TRI-rC method. The results obtained with this method show the division of the materials into three categories with overall bad, medium or good performance. The stability of results is verified against a two-fold sensitivity analysis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Supplier evaluation and categorization is an important decision process in supplier management. It relies on judgements by multiple decision makers about the performance of a supplier on a set of criteria. Uncertainty of judgements, non-compensation between criteria and group decision are the main requirements of the decision process that have to be considered. However, none of the studies found in the literature presents a solution that contemplates all this requirements at the same time. Therefore, aiming to bridge this gap, this paper proposes an approach to supplier categorization based on the use of ELECTRE TRI combined with hesitant fuzzy. ELECTRE TRI is a non-compensatory multicriteria decision making method specific for categorization. Hesitant fuzzy is used prior to it to aggregate linguistic judgements of multiple decision makers. The decision process model is detailed and implemented in Matlab©. Analyses of the results of an illustrative case of application in the automotive industry show consistent categorization results, particularly using the pessimistic ELECTRE TRI categorization procedure. But, when there is too much discordance, negotiation techniques may be a better option. Also, test with different criteria weights showed no change in the categorization results, confirming the non-compensatory effect of the technique. © 2018},

abstract={ELECTRE TRI-C, ELECTRE TRI-nC and THESEUS are recently proposed outranking-based multi-criteria sorting methods. The effectiveness of each method is here characterized by (i) its capacity for suggesting precise and appropriate assignments, (ii) the probability of suggesting imprecise assignments, and (iii) the probability of suggesting wrong assignments. We are also interested in studying to what extent the effectiveness of the methods is influenced by the number of criteria and categories, the cardinality of the reference set (in case of ELECTRE TRI-nC and THESEUS), and the way in which this set is chosen or populated. Our conclusions are supported by extensive computer experiments. The results underline the importance of (a) the number of reference actions and their distribution per category, (b) the number of criteria, and (c) the way in which the reference set is populated. These results help to identify contexts for which a particular method may be more appropriate. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={This work presents a methodology to perform a multi-criteria decision analysis based on qualitative assessments from multiple experts or stakeholders. The application that motivated these methodological developments is also described, consisting of an assessment of policies to foster technological innovations in the electricity sector, namely in a context of evolution to smart grids. Qualitative assessments were elicited from 28 experts using a Delphi process. The assessments concern the impact of policies on different objectives, but also opinions concerning the importance of these objectives. These opinions are translated into constraints on the weights of the corresponding criteria, in a partial information setting. Then, policies are sorted into categories based on a stochastic multi-criteria analysis for the ELECTRE TRI method. A new ranking approach is also developed to be compatible with the sorting results, based on a robustness analysis of ELECTRE TRI credibility indices. Results are discussed considering the entire set of experts and considering subsets of experts representing different perspectives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper proposes a new Human Development Index (HDI) classification method using as a basis the same dimensions and weights used by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), however, avoiding the compensatory effect and misclassification that can occur when UNDP approach is applied. The proposed approach also allows working with any set of dimensions and weights. The classification was performed by the Elimination Et Choix Traidusaint la Realite (ELECTRE TRI), a multicriteria method, in which classes were defined with the visual aid of a non-parametrically tool, the Kernel Density Estimation and the class profiles were calculated by the Jenks Natural Breaks algorithm. The proposed classification method achieved better results than the one adopted by the UNDP, because the countries could be classified accurately in their natural classes without occurring the compensation effect. However, when comparing with the HDI index we have obtained an accuracy of 76.60% for the first proposed model and 78.72% for the second one. Our proposal purely used the same dimensions and weights adopted by UNDP. The proposed method is more robust, closer to reality and can eliminate the compensatory effect between dimensions, thus it can provide more credibility to the HDI. The combination of the ELECTRE TRI method with statistical tools to define classes and class profiles for the HDI is unprecedented in the literature. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={We present a group decision making framework for evaluating sustainability of the insulating materials. We tested thirteen materials on a model that was applied to retrofit a traditional rural building through roof’s insulation. To evaluate the materials from the socio-economic and environmental viewpoints, we combined life cycle costing and assessment with an adaptive comfort evaluation. In this way, the performances of each coating material were measured in terms of an incurred reduction of costs and consumption of resources, maintenance of the cultural and historic significance of buildings, and a guaranteed indoor thermal comfort. The comprehensive assessment of the materials involved their assignment to one of the three preference-ordered sustainability classes. For this purpose, we used a multiple criteria decision analysis approach that accounted for preferences of a few tens of rural buildings’ owners. The proposed methodological framework incorporated an outranking-based preference model to compare the insulating materials with the characteristic class profiles while using the weights derived from the revised Simos procedure. The initial sorting recommendation for each material was validated against the outcomes of robustness analysis that combined the preferences of individual stakeholders either at the output or at the input level. The analysis revealed that the most favorable materials in terms of their overall sustainability were glass wool, hemp fibres, kenaf fibres, polystyrene foam, polyurethane, and rock wool. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={With the intensification of chronical disease within older people, concurrent use of different drugs (polypharmacy) is becoming increasingly frequent. However, there is no established manner to determine whether polypharmacy is appropriate or not. We propose an original method of classifying polypharmacy using multi-criteria decision-aid methods. To do this, we provided clinicians with a list of drugs that could be potentially prescribed to the typical elderly person suffering from three diseases (diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure). Clinicians expressed their opinion on a 5-point Likert scale, allowing for hesitation between two or more answers. They evaluated risks, benefits, and impacts of each drug on the patient’s quality of life. We then aggregated these evaluations in order to obtain, for each drug, a multi-criteria evaluation vector representing the collective opinion of the clinicians consulted. Subsequently, ELECTRE Tri-C and ELECTRE Tri multi-criteria methods were used to evaluate and assign the polypharmacy to one of the following three categories: appropriate, more or less appropriate, or inappropriate. © 2018 Newswood Limited.

abstract={In this paper a ranking method of urban intersections based on their hindering or facilitating effect on walking is proposed and tested on a sample of street crossings in the city of Alghero. The study investigates the effects of geometric and operational characteristics of urban intersections on pedestrian accessibility. Tthrough a detailed audit conducted on each node we collected a set of micro level data on the impact of intersections on wakability expressed by pedestrian: the comparison between objective and subjective information allowed to identify the most important influencing factors and their relative weight in the measure of walkability. Then we proceeded to classify intersections: the variety and diversity of attributes suggested the employment of a multicriteria ranking evaluative method: more precisely, we adapted the ELECTRE TRI rating method (Roy and Bouyssou, 1993) with the purpose of rating urban opportunities according to their influence on walking. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract={The European Framework Programme for Research and Innovation aims to facilitate the collaboration between public and private sectors in delivering innovation. To achieve this goal, Union Research and Innovation Programme provides various financial instruments, among which the Horizon 2020 is one of the most significant. Since its implementation, the Horizon 2020 has stimulated the interest of several research organizations making the partnerships among companies their core business for improving local economy. In this context, technological districts are the main proponents of research and innovation spreading in the local territory. In Sicily, the AgroBioPesca district exploited these opportunities, undertaking the strategic “Call for ideas” proposal with the aim of building its own roadmap for research and innovation. To such an aim, AgroBioPesca collected several innovative project ideas coherent with some Technological Trajectories (TT) provided by Horizon 2020 and in line with the national and local operational programmes. These project ideas have been evaluated by a technical and scientific committee, taking into account specific criteria related to the Horizon 2020 technical guidelines. This paper aims to select the AgroBioPesca best projects portfolio by applying the multiple criteria sorting method (MCSM) ELECTRE TRI. A sensitivity analysis has lastly been conducted in order to verify the robustness of the solutions obtained. © 2018 AIDI - Italian Association of Industrial Operations Professors.

funding_text 1={In the European context, the collaboration between public and private sectors in delivering innovation is encouraged by EU Research and Innovation Programme that provides various financial instruments, such as Horizon 2020 (H2020). This programme is EU’s biggest one for research and innovation and, since its implementation, has strongly motivated many investors of various business sectors. The paricitpation of companies has inceasred compared to H2020’s predecessor programme (the Seventh Framework Programme for Research), thanks to the focus of the last one on research and innovation and on their deployment and application. In this context, technological districts, that have been createtodpromote teritorrial deelovpment by means of research and innovation (Lerro and Jacobone, 2014), find opportunities of funding at national level (e.g. Programma Operativo Nazionale Ricerca&Innovazione 2014 – 2020-PON R&I 2014-220)0andinte rnational one (e.g. H2020) in orer dtodevelop their core business’ activities. They represent a fundamental component of the Italian research system and have contributed significantly to the development and competitiveness of the country (Lerro and Schiuma, 2015). In Sicily, the AgroBioPesca Technological District (TD) aims to promote the networking between private companies and public research institutions in orerdto create a network able to increase the competitiveness of the Sicilian territoryin hetekygr i-foaod sector. In order to take the funding opportunities made available by the EU, the TD has organised meetings between the main players in the regional agri-food sector to identify new and concrete solutions to promote innovation. In order to reach this goal the TD has identified the research topics on which the prjeoct ideas will be developed by means of a careful analysis of strategies at both European, national and local level. In particular, starting from the analysis of the documents of H2020 (The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. Brussels, 2011) and considering the peculiarities of the Sicilian territory (Strategia Regionale dell’Innovazione, SI-3)R, sixtechnological trajectories (TT) have been identified. For each TT manypla yers, beongling to private or public organizations, have presented several project ideas. These project ideas have been analysed by a technical and scientific committee in order to identify the most significant proposals with which the TD will participate in the funding calls provided with the 2014-2002 programming. The prpoosals have been assessed by taking into account several evaluation criteria defined in accordance with the H2020’s assessment guidelines and forms. In specific the criteria considered in the following paper are Impact, Excellence, Quality and Efficiency. The criteria weights were deterinmed by using the value reported in the H2020’s assessment form, instead the sub-criteria weights have been calculated by considering pillars’ budgets allocated by the European Commission (EC). Therefore, the study is a preliminary analysis that allows the TD to focus its attention only on project ideas with the most similar characteristics to H2020 standards by means of the application of a structured approach. The aim of the paper is to provide a methodology able to sort project ideas into three classes in order to define TD project portfolio: Rejected Project Ideas (RPI), Reviewable Project Ideas Ideas (EPI). The study conducted in this paper is dealt with a multi criteria methodology named ELECTRE TRI (Mousseau et al., 2000). This method, belonging to ELECTRE family methods (Roy, 1991), allows to sort alternatives/projects into predefined and ordered classes separated by reference profiles. These profiles have been defined by following H2020’s assessment forms. Indifference, preference and veto thresholds, necessary to implement the methodology, have been defined by TD’s board. Tis ahprpoah calowls decision makers to select a solution by tackling the complexity and uncertainty that could characterize the decision-making process. Moreover, ELECTRE TRI method has been used in literature to provide decision support in several kinds of problems. Reginaldo (2015) proposes to assess a portfolio of projects with the support of ELECTRE TRI approach by using the identification of the companies’ latent need for improvement intheportfolio management process. Sánchez-Lozano et al. (2014) use the same method to identify and classify the best plots for installing photovoltaic solar farms in the Muicipnality of Tore Pracheco, in the southeast of Spain. Mavrotas et al. (2003) addessrthe selection of projects for funding from the competent Greek auhortity for the installation of renewable wind energy plants in different regions of Greece. The selection among these projects is a multi criteia prroblem that has been solved with the support of a Decision-Aid tool combining the multi criteria classification method ELECTRE-TRI and Integer Linear Programming. Mota et al. (2012) propose a decision model for helping project managers to focus on the main tasks of a project network during its life cycle. The model assigns priorities classes and it’s solved by means ELECTRETRI-C method. Silva et al. (2014) study the assessment of the environmental sustainability of agricultural infrastructures of diry afrms inthe Entre-Douro-e-Minho (EDM) Region by developing aWeb MC-SDSS, named ELECTRE TRI in ArcGIS with which the system GIS is integrated with the results of multiple criteria decision-aid (MCDA) EETLRECTRI method. This paper aims at providing astructured, objective and transparent methodology (ELECTRE TRI approach) able to help the decision maker (AgroBioPesca TD) to focus on the most valuable received project ideas. In particular, the main goal is to create a project portfolio as objective as possible in compliance with H2020’s guidelines. The ELECTRE TRI method applied in this paper guarantees the TD to include the ECpolicy for selecting the project ideas. In fact, the more coherent the proposals to H2020’s objective ar, ethe greater the probability of the proposal to be financed ae. Ironrder to fulfil these goals, the parameters required by ELECTRE TRI, such as criteria weights and reference profiles are derived by H2020’s programme. The use of parameters recognized at European level permits the standardization of the main input necessary for methodology implementation avoiding errors that are in the nature of subjective evaluations. However, the methodology takes into account the TD preferences by means of the definition of the ELECTRE TRI thresholds’ values. These values are, in fact, set by the TDboard. Since},

abstract={Multicriteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) paradigm has been utilized in solving classification problems, as well as ranking and selection problems. MCDA classification methods are distinguished from the other ones because they allow the decision maker to intervene the model and have no statistical constraints. In this study, a novel MCDA classification method based on Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) is presented. The method, which is named GRA-TRI, allows defining a category by reference alternative and realize assignment by considering the mathematical and geometrical similarity in GRA. In the paper, firstly, the notations and assumptions of the method have been described. Then, an illustrative example was performed step by step. By comparing GRA-TRI and ELECTRE TRI-Central, it has been showed that GRA-TRI makes consistent and reasonable assignments.

abstract={A growing interest is expressed by organizations for the development of approaches enabling to take advantage of past experiences to improve their decision processes; they may be referred to as Lessons Learned (LL) processes. Within the LL processes implementation framework, the development of semi-automatic approaches able to distinguish criteria having major influence on the evaluation of experiences is crucial for identifying relevant recommendations and performing efficient prescriptive analysis. In this paper, we propose to contribute to LL study by focusing on the definition of an approach enabling, in a specific setting, to identify the criteria most influencing the decision process regarding the overall performance evaluation of a reduced set of experiences. The proposed approach is framed on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, and specifically is based on the Electre tri method. In this paper, an illustration of the proposed approach is provided studying the evaluation of logistical response strategies in humanitarian emergency situations. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={Outranking methods are a specific type of Multi-Criteria Decision Aiding methods. They are based on the construction of binary relations validating or invalidating, for any pair of alternatives (a, b), the assertion “a outranks b”. This comparison is grounded on the evaluation vectors of both alternatives, and on additional information concerning the decision maker’s preferences, typically accounting for two conditions: concordance and non-discordance. In decision processes using these methods, the analyst should interact with the decision maker in order to elicit values for the parameters that define a preference model. This can be done either directly or through a disaggregation procedure that infers parameter values from holistic judgements provided by the decision maker. In this chapter we discuss the elicitation of an outranking-based preference model, focusing on the valued outranking relation used in the ELECTRE III and ELECTRE TRI methods. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Sidewalks constitute the main guideway for the walking mode of transport and serve as a fundamental infrastructure for personal travel including commuting. This is because practically every motorized trip is preceded or concluded by nonmotorized travel. The assessment of sidewalk performance, in the sense of its suitability for walking, involves consideration of multiple aspects, whose precise treatment requires in turn the use of multicriteria methods to support decisions. This article proposes a multicriteria methodology for this purpose, thus setting the stage for a subsequent agency decision regarding maintenance strategy development. The methodology is based on a set of infrastructure attributes, directly intervenable by these authorities, and uses the ELECTRE TRI method to assign sidewalks under study to performance classes. It is practical to use and can be applied to any city, at any scale. The approach is thoroughly discussed, and demonstrated for a case study comprising several sidewalks in the city of Coimbra, Portugal. The results indicate that a considerable fraction of these sidewalks are in mediocre condition, and the multicriteria classifying methodology readily suggested intervention strategies, effectively aiding in the decision making. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={This paper presents a new method for multiple criteria ordinal classification (sorting) problems. In an ordinal classification problem, the categories (also called classes in related literature) are pre-defined and ordered, from the best to the worst or from the worst to the best. The actions (not necessarily known a priori) are assigned to the different ordered categories. Several ELECTRE type methods were designed to deal with this kind of problem. However, none of them proposes a characterization of the categories through a set of limiting profiles. This is the novelty of the current method, which may be considered as an extension of ELECTRE TRI-B. It fulfills a set of structural requirements: uniqueness of the assignments, independence, monotonicity, homogeneity, conformity, and stability with respect to merging and splitting operations. All these features will be presented in the current paper and illustrated through three examples. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper reports on an application of the VICA-ELECTRE TRI to a real world case study. We used the model VICA (Visual, Interactive and Comparative Analysis of individual opinions) to aid a cooperative group achieving a collective solution to a multicriteria sorting problem (student allocation to classes on a language school). Based on the individual results initially obtained, the model provides tools for the visualization of results and their comparison. It also points out means to seek or build a consensus on a solution, by guiding the changes of parameters and/or preference revisions in different possible ways of interaction between the members of the group. After a brief description of the model, we present the procedures followed, from the meeting plan to the case analysis. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={A significant part of each risk informed land-use planning methodology, applied in the surroundings of Seveso installations, is the assessment of the vulnerability of all possible potential human and environmental targets. This paper focuses on the enhancement of the transparency of these methodologies, through the application of ELECTRE TRI, which is a well known and structured multi-criteria methodology. A broad set of multiple and conflicting criteria is considered, ranging from population safety and potential environmental impacts to socio-economic criteria. Additionally, a procedure for the facilitation of the inferring process of the parameters of the multi-criteria model is also presented, along with a case study, related to the statutory land-use types of the Greek Town Master Plan. © 2017, Gh.

abstract={Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is an engineering technique aimed at the detection of potential failures, their causes and consequences on the system/process under investigation. When used for the failure modes prioritization, FMEA is also referred to as Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). In traditional FMECA, risk priorities of failure modes are determined through the Risk Priority Number (RPN), which is a function of the three risk parameters Occurrence (O), Severity (S), and Detection (D). In the present paper, an alternative approach to the RPN is proposed for the criticality assessment of process/system failure modes. Particularly, the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method ELECTRE TRI is employed to assign failure modes to predefined and ordered risk classes, from the highest to the lowest risky one. Contrarily to the traditional RPN, the method allows the Decision Maker (DM) at taking into account the relative importance of risk parameters as well as his/her uncertainty in assigning each failure mode to a specific risk class. The ELECTRE TRI-based approach is implemented on the applicative case proposed by Kurt and Özilgen (2013) with reference to Turkish dairy manufacturing industries. A sensitivity analysis is finally performed in order to test the influence of the input parameters on the classification results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Over the last decades, the delivery of water supply services has changed among regions and actors, in order to meet the changing needs. Those services can be balanced based on the relation between the obligations they must fulfill, the quality offered, and the associated price/value for money. Furthermore, due to the water services inherent characteristics, they are prone to poor quality of service (in general terms). Thus, global performance assessments are of paramount relevance under those constraints. In Portugal, the water regulator has developed a system of performance indicators (partial measures of performance) and, therefore, it is not possible to achieve the desired holistic performance evaluation (global measure). To enable such assessment, we propose an application based on the ELECTRE TRI-nC method to define quality of service categories and aggregate performance indicators. To obtain a coherent family of criteria (i.e., exhaustive, cohesive, and non-redundant) we apply an iso-preference logic. The results obtained are presented through a geographical information system allowing for a clearer visualization of the overall performance of water utilities. The method proposed can be considered a suitable decision support system and useful regulatory tool able to provide policy relevant outputs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We propose a decision-aiding evaluation procedure (i) for classifying road crossings based on their impact on walkability and, subsequently, (ii) for prioritising street improvements, in urban-rural fringe areas. In the peripheral urban-rural fringes, pedestrian mobility is usually less developed and people generally depend more on cars for their everyday chores. Partly this is inevitable given the structural features and supply of services and activities in such areas, but part is due to a frequent neglect of pedestrian mobility in planning and urban design. Measures to improve this state of affairs can include the design of more pedestrian-friendly environments offering to potential users a greater level of security, comfort and convenience when walking to their designated destinations. Our evaluation procedure combines a walkability assessment methodology with the ELECTRE TRI rating procedure, in order to assist planners and decision makers in designing physical streets to enhance the continuity, safety and quality of pedestrian paths. Improving the walking accessibility in the fringe areas of towns is a way to reduce the physical and perceptual distance which separates these contexts from the rest of the city, thus leading to a progressive integration of urban functions. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={In the past decade, there has been an increasing interest in green supply chain management, which integrates environmental thinking into supply chain management. Assessing a supplier’s potential for improvement is very important when an organization wants to achieve certain environmental targets concerning their supply base, taking into account the limited resources available. In this paper, incorporating environmental evaluation criteria into a comprehensive supplier segmentation approach called ‘supplier potential matrix’ (SPM), a green supplier segmentation is proposed to segment the suppliers. Two overarching dimensions—supplier’s capabilities and supplier’s willingness—are used to evaluate the supplier’s green potential. The two dimensions are measured by multiple criteria. A sorting method called ELECTRE TRI-rC is used to solve the resulted multi-criteria decision-making problem. In order to make a more meaningful distinction, a simple method is also proposed to assess the suppliers with respect to the carbon footprint of the raw materials they supply. The results of this assessment are combined with the ones of the SPM, resulting in a more useful segmentation. The proposed model is applied to a sample containing the suppliers of a large international company. © 2017 The Author(s)},

abstract={Nowadays there is a real need to operate and link existing knowledge expressed by experts, in domains in which highly reliable recommendation systems are needed. This is especially true in the medical domain where knowledge sources are heterogeneous, since they are separately formed in different contexts. A major difficulty is to relate these sources together in a way that respects the specic medical recommendation requirements. Using MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making) models can help in this aim. The general problem we address is to assess the suitability of an alternative (or a solution) for a given subject in a specific context. For instance, which antibiotic (alternative) should be prescribed to a patient (subject) who suffers from bacterial infection, taking into account characteristics of the patient such as allergies, renal problems, etc. We use a MCDM sorting method (MR-Sort with Veto, a variant of ELECTRE TRI), to categorize the pairs alternative-solution (e.g. antibiotic-patient) according to their degree of suitability. The contextual knowledge (e.g. side-effects of antibiotics, characteristics of patient), structured in several ontologies, is linked to the assessment model through a semantic model. The approach is applied to the recommendation of antibiotic prescription, in collaboration with the EpiCura Hospital Center. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The success or failure of a construction project depends largely on the contractor's performance since they are responsible for important activities in the building process. In this way, it is necessary to monitor the performance of the contractors who already working with the organization to control failures during the development of work. Due the complexity and necessity of considering various criteria in the decision making; it is a multicriteria problem. Additionally, contractor evaluation method should classify them according to performance levels to help the client to decide whether to hire the contractor for future projects. In this context, the model proposed uses ELECTRE TRI method to classify the construction contractors according to their performance. Subsequently, a literature review was made to identify the most used criteria to assess contractors in the construction industry. Then, these criteria were used in a numerical simulation of the proposed model. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Even small improvements in storage operations can bring significant benefits in customer response time, increasing the level of service offered. However, a company cannot offer high level of service for all products. In this sense, one of the ways used to optimize the activities for order picking is the study of storage location assignment problem (SLAP). Thus, this paper proposed a multi-criteria decision model to perform the products classification and to solve the SLAP in a multi-layer warehouse. The ELECTRE TRI method is used to define the shelf level for each product, and the ELECTRE III method is used to establish a fixed location for each product on the shelf it belongs to. The great advantage of this model is that there is not trade-off among the criteria, and it is able to consider several criteria simultaneously. However, the main goal is not optimization, but the search for a storage operations performance balance, considering multiple criteria, allowing for a better inventory management when considering profitability criteria, for example, and improvement in the order picking operations, through the demand and space required criteria. In addition, it considers the preferences of the decision maker. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={Periodically, organizations need to change the quality management aspects of processes and products in order to suit the demands of their internal and external (consumer and competitor market) environments. In the context of the present study, quality management changes involve tools, programs, methods, standards and procedures that can be applied. The purpose of this study is to help senior management to identify types of change and, consequently, determine how it should be correctly conducted within an organization. The methodology involves a classification model, with multicriteria support, and three organizational change ratings were adopted (the extremes, type I and type II, as confirmed in the literature, and the intermediary, proposed herein). The multicriteria method used was ELECTRE TRI and the model was applied to two companies of the Textile Local Productive Arrangement in Pernambuco, Brazil. The results are interesting and show the consistency and coherence of the proposed classification model. © 2018 Production.},

abstract={The ELECTRE-TRI multiple criteria decision making method is applied to assist the distribution centres of a Brazilian retail enterprise in order to decide on the investment to be carried out in a new technological structure to be implemented in the central data processing system of the company. This paper illustrates the application of this methodology in a real case study in a major retail chain of stores in Brazil. The practical application of this type of methodology has demonstrated several positive points and huge opportunities for improvement to make it more and more innovative, a very useful tool for decision making in Lojas Americanas.},

abstract={Association rule mining plays a vital role in knowledge discovery in databases. The difficult task is mining useful and non-redundant rules, in fact in most cases, the real datasets lead to a huge number of rules, which does not allow users to make their own selection of the most relevant. Several techniques are proposed such as rule clustering, informative cover method, quality measurements, etc. Another way to selecting relevant association rules, we believe it is necessary to integrate a decisional approach within the knowledge discovery process; to solve the problem, we propose an approach to discover a category of relevant association rules based on multi-criteria analysis (MCA) by using association rules as actions and quality measurements as criteria. Finally, we conclude our work by an empirical study to illustrate the performance of our proposed approach. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This work presents a multi-criteria classification system considering multiple, conflicting and incommensurate evaluation aspects influencing energy efficiency in school buildings. The multi-criteria ELECTRE TRI method is used to classify energy performance of school buildings into categories of merit using the IRIS software. The alternatives under evaluation are assigned to predefined ordered categories according to their absolute performance and not in comparison with the performance of other alternatives. Each alternative is assessed using reference profiles defining the boundaries of the categories in which the alternatives should be sorted. The model was applied using a set of performance indicators obtained in the framework of a research and development project aimed at assessing the energy performance of a sample of Portuguese school buildings. IRIS allowed inferring robust conclusions by indicating the range of categories for each alternative, considering the decision maker's preferences, captured by the parameters of ELECTRE TRI. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={The layered evaluation of interactive adaptive systems has to consider many evaluation methods. The best evaluation method to be used for individual layers depend on many parameters such as the evaluation criteria, the stage of the development cycle, and the characteristics of the layer under consideration. This paper presents a decision model for selecting the appropriate evaluation methods for individual layers of the interactive adaptive system. Our proposal is based on one multi-criteria method, namely ELECTRE TRI method. The proposed decision model is applied to determine the suitable evaluation methods for an adaptive hypermedia system.

abstract={Several stakeholders are increasingly interested in operational risks and their impact on key business projects such as outsourcing projects. To guide stakeholders and project managers to take decisions related to the outsourcing of one or multiple activities, we propose a decision support system for classifying organizational risks, as example of operational risks, into different risk categories. The classification system is based on a set of performance metrics that measure both the likelihood and impact criterias. Electre-Tri a formal multi-criteria decision analysis method, was used as the foundation for this task. This method allowed us to cluster various organizational risks in different risk categories based on our current knowledge of those risks, and based on the best professional judgments. A numerical application based on a real case is presented. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Maintaining relationships with suppliers has become a critical strategic management issue to business. As a consequence, the tasks of evaluating and selecting suppliers are essential, given that companies delegate part of their business to partners. The main purpose of these tasks is to identify suppliers with the highest potential for meeting a buyer's needs consistently and at an acceptable overall performance. However these tasks are complex since they involve a variety of conflicting criteria, which makes the problem one that can be tackled by an multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) approach. Moreover, companies have suppliers whose features and performance are different and buyers need to decide at each level how they may best collaborate with each type of supplier. Many papers in the literature have addressed this situation involving supplier selection; nevertheless, most of them present methods to solve ranking and choice problems. The objective of this paper is to propose a model for the strategic management of suppliers which uses the ELECTRE TRI method to sort suppliers into classes of collaboration. Therefore, by using this model it is possible for companies to do so in order to define the most appropriate strategies to adopt for each category. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={This paper is to select the best locations to build solar photovoltaic farms (large grid-connected photovoltaic systems which have more than 100 kWp of installed capacity), with the coast of Murcia in the southeast of Spain being used as an example. In order to solve the problem, the suitable locations to implant such facilities will be identified by a Geographical Information System (GIS). To obtain the weights of the criteria which influence the proposed problem, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) will be employed. Then, the suitable locations will be evaluated and classified using two different multi-criteria decision methods, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and ELimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE), in this case the version TRI. We are thus also able to establish a comparison between the two methods. This comparison demonstrates how although the results do not completely coincide, some similarity can be seen between the two methods. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Sorting methods, in particular ELECTRE Tri methods, are widely used in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding to deal with ordinal classification problems. Problems of this kind encountered in practice involve the evaluation of different alternatives (actions) on several evaluation criteria that are structured in a hierarchical way. In order to deal with a hierarchical structure of criteria in decision problems, Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process (MCHP) has been recently proposed. In this paper, we apply the MCHP to the ELECTRE-Tri methods. In particular, we extend ELECTRE Tri-B, ELECTRE Tri-C and ELECTRE Tri-nC methods. We also adapt the MCHP concept to the case where interaction among evaluation criteria has either strengthening, or weakening, or antagonistic effect. Finally, we present an extension of the SRF method to determine the weights of criteria in case they are hierarchically structured. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) or Evidence Theory is regarded as one of the leading theories for modeling uncertainty in imprecise situations. The main advantage of this theory arises from the possibility of combining different bodies of evidence originally developed by using Dempster's combination rule. However, this rule leads to counter-intuitive results when the bodies of evidence conflict with each other to a high degree. Thus, different combinations of conflict management rules have been developed over the years where, regardless of the method used, what should be identified first of all is the level of conflict between the bodies of evidence. Therefore, different metrics were used to classify or quantify the conflict but no single one of these was successful because it is impracticable to represent all situations of conflict in this theory by using only one metric. Therefore, the contribution of this article is to analyze conflict within DST by using a multi-criteria analysis, for which the Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method considered was ELECTRE TRI. On modeling the problem, three classes of conflict (low, medium and high), were considered. To validate the model, a numerical analysis was conducted that included the use of a method to point up conflict so as to infer parameters. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The chapter presents a model for the design of an electric car sharing service for the city of Milan. Several options of service configurations have been analyzed and evaluated according to indicators measuring the performance of such options in respect to relevant dimensions (i.e. economic and financial costs and revenues, mobility, social benefits and environmental effects). We set up a multi-criteria assessment, structured by means of cognitive maps. Causal networks to estimate the effects of the options have been identified and instantiated by means of simulation techniques and other qualitative and quantitative models. The focus of the chapter is on the development and use of the causal maps and their integration with a multi-criteria assessment, based on the ELECTRE TRI rating method. The use of cognitive maps allowed to us capture the multiple values of the problem and the value trees of stakeholders' objectives. The proposed method can be useful for design of mobility services, especially at a strategic level. © ISTE Ltd 2016. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Classification problems refer to the assignment of alternatives to predefined categories. In this work we focus on ordered classification, called sorting, in which the predefined categories indicate several degrees of interest or suitability of alternatives for a certain user. The assignment of alternatives is based on multiple conflicting criteria. This multi-criteria sorting approach is specially interesting for recommender systems aimed at finding the most suitable alternatives for each user. First, we study the ELECTRE-TRI-B sorting method, which follows the outranking approach based on comparing the evaluations of alternatives with the profile limits separating the categories. The complexity of some recommenders systems requires the extension of the classical ELECTRE-TRI-B method to manage a taxonomical organization of the set of criteria. In this paper we consider a set of criteria in the form of a hierarchy. The intermediate criteria in such a hierarchy correspond to different aspects of the recommendation procedure, such as content, context or cost. At each of these criteria, a sorting problem must be solved. Therefore, we propose extending ELECTRE-TRI-B to handle assignments of alternatives on several levels of the hierarchy. A hierarchical procedure for sorting is proposed, called ELECTRE-TRI-B-H. Secondly, the paper explains the integration of ELECTRE-TRI-B-H into a recommender system of touristic activities related to wine, called GoEno-Tur. This system is developed for the region of Tarragona, Catalonia (Spain), which is a well-recognized area of wine and cava production. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The usefulness and relevance of association rules extracted by the generation algorithms are a critical problem. In fact, in most cases, the real datasets lead to a very large number of association rules, which does not allow users to make their own selection of the most relevant. The searching of the best from the vast array of extracted rules require the identification and use of good measures or techniques of choice. Partial panoramas of these are presented in numerous publications. In this context, we propose a new approach to selecting relevant categories of association rules based on multi criteria analysis using association rules as actions and measures as criteria. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Territorial decision problems have a spatial complex nature which is also multidimensional, interdisciplinary, poorly defined and requiring the definition of several criteria with dissimilar importance. These types of problem involve many decision makers (individuals and institutions), with conflicting interests, preferences and points of view. In the current study, our contribution focuses on the design and development of a multicriteria spatial group decision support system to conduct the spatial localization process in Territory Planning: the problem that involves finding a surface that best meets certain criteria from a set of variants (the location of infrastructure: shopping center, hospital, school, . . . ). The suggested system SIGMAS allows taking into account both the spatial dimension as well as specific and divergent interests of different decision makers to reach an acceptable agreement. In this context, the proposed SGDSS is based on the coupling of two representations of reality: Multi Agent Systems (MAS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).We endow the MAS with a negotiation protocol based on mediation, featuring a coordinator agent responsible for the smooth conduct of negotiation and a set of participant agents representing different decision makers impacted by the decision in TP. This protocol exploits, also, multicriteria analysis methods namely ELECTRE III and ELECTRE TRI. © 2016 IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Many companies today have embraced the concept of risk management, usually in the form of enterprise risk management or supply chain risk management. Both are based on a holistic view of risks. Hence, risks related to specific functions within a company must be considered more broadly than previously. Risks, however, involve uncertainty, and the less specific the context in which risks are viewed, the more uncertainty will be involved. One particular way to express uncertainty is through trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TrIFNs). In this paper, risks that are relevant for supplier risk assessments are first collected from the literature. Then it is illustrated how the multi-criteria decision analysis method ELECTRE TRI-C can be used for sorting suppliers into risk categories, when the risks as well as some of the method's parameters are expressed with TrIFNs. In order to do this, we make use of a small modification of an existing method for converting TrIFNs into crisp values. The approach is illustrated in a case problem based on a company that is looking for service providers (suppliers) of electrical maintenance. The problem involves 20 suppliers that are sorted into three risk categories based on evaluations from 27 criteria. Results from the case study point to two low risk suppliers. A further ad-hoc analysis suggests one of these to be less risky than the other. © 2016 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide to the entrepreneurs, and propose to the scientific community, a newly structured knowledge system that includes the quality of customers and suppliers, to facilitate learning processes about the current state of the enterprise and new strategic approaches. Design/methodology/approach: The knowledge system is elaborated combining a long day-by-day experience in a specific Italian field [the independent after market (IAM)] with the theoretical knowledge of both economic and financial issues and multiple criteria (MC) methods of decision aid. The economic and financial key performance indicators are generated ad hoc for a specific sector and created with the concept that a company is in the center of a network composed of its suppliers, customers, competitors and the State. An MC model easily and consistently includes aspects that are different in terms of source and formal language. An MC method transparently synthesizes all these elements in relation to a specific decision problem. Integrating the potential of MC models and methods with economic and financial issues and context experience facilitates an effective knowledge transfer to the operators of the sector. Findings: This methodology is oriented to the companies involved in the IAM and in particular to the manufacture, distributor and spare parts dealer categories (in Italy, almost 500 manufacturers, 150 distributors and 5,000 dealers). Manufacturers can use the methodology and its results to know the economic and financial performances of their customers, distributors can identify their strengths and weaknesses and the situation of their competitors and dealers can identify the most reliable future partners. Also, foreign manufacturers may be interested in this analysis, before selling in Italy, and banks and financiers could consult our knowledge frameworks to analyze the risk default. Originality/value: The added value of this approach is to allow even small and medium enterprises, without an internal know-how for economic analyses, to use tools that clarify their relations with the interested parties of the macroeconomic system and facilitate the quality assessment of their portfolio of customers/suppliers. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Project risk management plays a fundamental role in the project management field. Project objectives may dynamically change in time, hence it is not easy to satisfy them, especially when related to complex projects. In detail, they can be subjected to several and different risk conditions which have an important impact on the project success. In this context, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are effective tools to carry out the risk management. In particular, the present research proposes the use of MCDM with a specific focus on the ELECTRE TRI method. The last one is able to evaluate and assign projects under analysis into ordered and different risk classes. The purpose consists in extending the idea of the "probability and impact matrix" tool by adopting a multidimensional perspective. The proposed approach is applied to a case study related to an Oil & Gas project and a sensitivity analysis is shown to demonstrate the robustness of the results.},

abstract={Outsourcing functions such as logistics has become an industry trend towards cost-effectiveness and high service level performance. Many firms have acknowledged the benefits of relying on external experts in a need to empower their abilities. The pharmaceutical industry in particular is challenged by constant evolution of their development and manufacturing processes. Outsourcing logistics becomes then an attractive option for firms to focus on their core competencies. However, alongside the numerous benefits of outsourcing, various risks arise with the implementation of this option. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting a decision model that takes into consideration risks of outsourcing logistics in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Risk identification and a multi-criteria risk assessment model using ELECTRE TRI are described. © 2016},

abstract={The Human Development Index (HDI) is an indicator that measures individuals’ welfare through three dimensions: health, education and income. Since its conception, the HDI has been a focus of attention for various segments of society such as politicians, professionals in the media, policy makers, academics and ordinary citizens. The index, however, has received several criticisms over the years, the compensatory effect between the dimensions being the main one. In this context, this paper puts forward an alternative approach for calculating the Municipal Human Development Index, thereby mitigating some criticisms of the index and supporting public decision making. For this purpose, the ELECTRE TRI-C multicriteria method was used, in order to attenuate the compensatory effect, to reduce calculation problems and to allow comparison year by year. An application was conducted in the city of Recife, Pernambuco, in order to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach. As a result, a more adequate classification of the regions in four levels of human development was obtained. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The scientific monograph, 2008; Budzihski, Architecture of information system for generating multi-criteria decision-making solution (part. 2.), Organization of information structures and the functioning of the system, 2015). The system supports the multi-faceted (multi-methodical) and multi-criteria decision analysis, which includes: the selection (MLP optimization), ranking (AHP) and grouping (Electre Tri) of decision variants (called the objects of analysis). The first part of the study focused on the transformation of the information structure of partial mathematical models, reflecting the objects of analysis, to the form of records of the database and on their connection into a more complex structure, so-called multi-model, in order to subject the method of multi-criteria optimization to calculations. There was also mentioned the possibility of transformation of these complex structures from data records to a simple, tabular form transferred on the inputs of method. In the second part discussed the issue of the bi-directional data transformation (from the linguistic form into numerical, and vice versa). Data transformations are based on the use of fuzzy set logic and specially developed for thus purpose scoring and linguistic scales of the ordinal nature. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={The choice of process modelling language can affect business process management (BPM) since each modelling language shows different features of a given process and may limit the ways in which a process can be described and analysed. However, choosing the appropriate modelling language for process modelling has become a difficult task because of the availability of a large number modelling languages and also due to the lack of guidelines on evaluating, and comparing languages so as to assist in selecting the most appropriate one. This paper proposes a framework for selecting a modelling language in accordance with the purposes of modelling. This framework is based on the semiotic quality framework (SEQUAL) for evaluating process modelling languages and a multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) approach in order to select the most appropriate language for BPM. This study does not attempt to set out new forms of assessment and evaluation criteria, but does attempt to demonstrate how two existing approaches can be combined so as to solve the problem of selection of modelling language. The framework is described in this paper and then demonstrated by means of an example. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of using SEQUAL and MCDA in an integrated manner are discussed. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The performance evaluation of competencies is one of the most promising tools for assessing human capital in organizations. However, the analysis of multiple axes at the same time is complex and prone to error. The aim of this study is to propose the use of multicriteria support to aid the decision maker in evaluating competencies. To this end, the multicriteria method called ELECTRE TRI was used to analyze the competencies and accomplish classification of the employees. The competencies axes, Skills, Knowledge and Attitude (SKA) are used in the method as criteria while the evaluated employees were the "alternatives". A field study involving 91 employees working in Call Center Company of Pernambuco State (Brazil) was conducted. The results showed that it is possible to perform specific modeling for each type of function. In the groups of attendants, approximately 15% of workers demonstrated poor performance. Analogously, similar results were observed in 10% of managers. The model arises as a support in the processes of firing, hiring and training. © Medwell Journals, 2016.},

abstract={This article presents a methodology to classify light-duty vehicles according to their environmental impacts. The classification is based on Life-Cycle Impact Assessment indicators and vehicle operation indicators, which are aggregated using a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method. In contrast with most literature combining Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) and MCDA, vehicles are not compared directly; they are compared to pre-established profiles defining a set of classes. These profiles are established relatively to the impacts of the country's light-duty fleet. The ELECTRE TRI method is chosen for MCDA classification, thus avoiding complete substitutability among criteria and allowing for imprecision in the data. MCDA typically incorporates the subjective values of decision makers, namely through criteria weighting. To obtain conclusions that are not contingent on a given weight vector, we consider a space of weight vectors defined by constraints with a clear rationale and obtain all the possible results compatible with those constraints. The methodology is applied to classify six vehicles available in Portugal with different powertrains: Gasoline and Diesel Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles, Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (10 and 40-mile battery range) and Battery Electric Vehicle. The discussion suggests how this methodology might be useful for a decision-making entity that wishes to classify vehicles according to their environmental impacts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We present a new multiple criteria sorting approach that uses characteristic profiles for defining the classes and outranking relation as the preference model, similarly to the Electre Tri-C method. We reformulate the conditions for the worst and best class assignments of Electre Tri-C to increase comprehensibility of the method and interpretability of the results it delivers. Then, we present a disaggregation procedure for inferring the set of outranking models compatible with the given preference information, and use the set in deriving, for each decision alternative, the necessary and possible assignments. Furthermore, we introduce simplified assignment procedures and prove that they maintain a no class jumps-property in the possible assignments. Application of the proposed approach is demonstrated by classifying 40 land zones in 4 classes representing different risk levels. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper discusses the properties of the asymmetric part of an outranking relation built as in ELECTRE. Such relations have been used in the pseudodisjunctive version of ELECTRE TRI-B. We show that they have properties that are somewhat different from that of outranking relations. Indeed, contrary to outranking relations, they allow to have at the same time veto and bonus effects. We suggest that this explains the difficulty in analyzing the properties of the pseudodisjunctive version of ELECTRE TRI-B and the complexity of the elicitation methods of its parameters. We present conditions that characterize such relations. © 2014 The Authors. International Transactions in Operational Research © 2014 International Federation of Operational Research Societies.},

abstract={Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) face many obstacles when they try to access the credit market. These obstacles increase if the SMEs are innovative. In this case, financial data are insufficient or even unreliable. Thus, building a judgmental rating model, mainly based on qualitative criteria (soft information), is very important to finance SMEs' activities. Till now, there has not been a multicriteria credit risk model based on soft information for innovative SMEs. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by presenting a multicriteria credit risk model named ELECTRE-TRI. A SMAA-TRI analysis is also implemented to obtain robust SMEs' assignments to the risk classes. SMAA-TRI incorporates ELECTRE-TRI by considering different sets of preference parameters and uncertainty in the data via Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we carry out a real case study with the aim of illustrating the multicriteria credit risk model. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The aim of the present paper is to determine the best location to host a solar thermoelectric power plant. We will seek to show how Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) such as the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS method) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), are an excellent combination to solve complex locations problems. The coast of the Region of Murcia in the southeast of Spain has been chosen as the study area to carry out this evaluation. The GIS will be shown to be a very useful tool, since GIS are able to generate a database which serves as a starting point for conducting any decision support system. The posed problem will be resolved using restrictions to reduce the area of study, and the criteria that will influence the decision-making. These criteria will be of different natures; with quantitative criteria (numerical values) coexisting with qualitative criteria (labels and linguistic variables). In this article, AHP will be used to obtain the weights of the criteria, and the fuzzy TOPSIS method for the evaluation of the alternatives. In order to compare the results obtained with TOPSIS, the ELECTRE-TRI methodology will be applied. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={ELECTRE TRI is a set of methods designed to sort alternatives evaluated on several criteria into ordered categories. The original method uses limiting profiles. A recently introduced method uses central profiles. We study the relations between these two methods. We do so by investigating if an ordered partition obtained with one method can also be obtained with the other method, after a suitable redefinition of the profiles. We also investigate a number of situations in which the original method using limiting profiles gives results that do not fit well our intuition. This leads us to propose a variant of ELECTRE TRI that uses limiting profiles. We show that this variant may have some advantages over the original method. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A hybrid multi-objective approach based on GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) and SA (Simulated Annealing) meta-heuristics is proposed to provide decision support in a direct load control problem in electricity distribution networks. The main contributions of this paper are new techniques for the incorporation of preferences in these meta-heuristics and their hybridization. Preferences are included in the construction phase of multi-objective GRASP, in SA, as well as in the selection of solutions that go to the next generation, with the aim to obtain solutions more in accordance with the preferences elicited from a decision maker. The incorporation of preferences is made operational using the principles of the ELECTRE TRI method, which is based on the exploitation of an outranking relation in the framework of the sorting problem. © 2014 IEEE.},

Based on the identification of latent need for improvement in the portfolio management process, this study proposes to assess and balance a portfolio of projects with a support tool for multi-criteria decision by the French School, the ELECTRE TRI. Different from some proposals, in this article we discuss the evaluation and portfolio balancing as a sorting problem. Furthermore, in order to make the process viable for any type of companies, we use the IRIS tool that implements the ELECTRE TRI and is extremely user-friendly. ©2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This chapter presents multicriteria (MCDM/A) models to classify and assign maintenance priorities in order to allow maintenance planning to be more effective. From traditional maintenance planning techniques such as RCM (Reliability Centered Maintenance), TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) and others, a common aspect of these techniques is the definition of maintenance priorities, based on a criticality classification for RCM, for example. As maintenance planning has to satisfy multiple objectives, such as availability, maintainability, detectability, safety and reliability besides cost, the maintenance manager is a decision maker (DM) who has to establish tradeoff amongst multiple criteria. This chapter presents an MCDM/A model integrated with the RCM structure using Utility Theory principles to include states of nature and the DM’s behavior to risk (prone, neutral and averse) in a decision model based on Multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT). To illustrate situations when a DM has a non-compensatory rationality, and requires an outranking method, a decision model based on ELECTRE TRI is applied. In addition, TPM aspects are discussed in order to emphasize potential MCDM/A problems that may be approached. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Accidents involve critical consequences that require an appropriate and efficient form of risk management. A multidimensional risk analysis allows a broader view. MCDM/A approaches enable more consistent decision-making, taking into account the DM’s rationality (compensatory or non-compensatory), DM’s behavior regarding risk (prone, neutral or averse) and the uncertainties inherent in the risk context. This chapter presents numerical applications illustrating the use of multicriteria models in two different contexts: a natural gas pipeline and an underground electricity distribution system. Two different MCDM/A approaches are considered: MAUT (Multiattribute Utility Theory) and the ELECTRE TRI outranking method. In the numerical applications, MCDM/A approach steps for building decision models are presented: identifying hazard scenarios, estimating the set of payoffs, eliciting the MAU function (Multi-attribute Utility function), computing the probability function of consequences and estimating multidimensional risk. Loss functions are introduced in the models to calculate the probability distribution functions over the multiple criteria such as impact on humans, and environmental and financial losses. Therefore, Decision Theory concepts are applied to estimate risk in industrial plants and modes of transportation. Finally, other decision problems related to multidimensional risk analysis, using MCDM/A, are considered in different contexts, such as: power electricity systems, natural hazards, risk analysis on counter-terrorism, nuclear power plant. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={In case of an accident concerning a nuclear installation, two intervention phases are distinguished: An emergency phase which calls for a rapid and organized response through intervention plans, and a post-accidental phase in which postponed actions are carried out on medium and/or long-term so that the situation comes back to a state judged as acceptable by stakeholders. The PRIME project has developed a decision aiding tool for risk managers involved in an industrial accident involving radioactive substances, through the evaluation of radio-ecological sensitivity of a territory in a post-accidental phase. The proposed decision aiding tool is grounded on the integration of Multiple Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) and a Geographical Information System (GIS). The proposed methodology relies on the concept of decision map which corresponds to a planar subdivision of the territory in which each subdivision is evaluated on the basis of several criterion maps. This results in a set of disjoint spatial units evaluated on an ordinal scale using the ELECTRE TRI method. Hence, the result is a decision map representing the radio-ecological sensitivity of the territory; such maps prove to be very useful for stakeholders to design relevant post-accidental strategies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

abstract={The size and capacity of Data Centers (DCs) is growing at a rapid pace to meet the increased demand of data processing and storage capacity requested by a digital information society. Since DCs are infrastructures that have large energy consumption, there is a need to change their design approach to make them more efficient and more environment friendly. This research was motivated by the planning of a new DC in Portugal. It proposes a multi-criteria framework to assess the sustainability of a DC, which includes a newmetric to evaluate the DC efficiency taking into account the environmental conditions of the DC location. ELECTRE TRI was chosen for aggregating different metrics concerning the environmental sustainability of a DC into sustainability categories. The evaluation methodology allows some freedom for each DC to place more weight on the aspects in which it is stronger, an analysis facilitated by the IRIS decision support system. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

It can help to support the definition of politics promoting a sustainable development of the region. A spatial decision support model is built, based on a coupling of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) on the one hand and a Geographic Information System (GIS) on the other hand. The ELECTRE TRI method is used to sort the spatial units to ordered categories corresponding to various levels of response to the risk of landscape degradation. The model allows to aggregate physical, economical, socio-cultural and environmental aspects interpreted in terms of their impact on landscape preservation or degradation. Such a categorization leads to the determination of homogeneous zones in the region under study. It can possibly serve as a basis for allocating resources to the most promising sub-regions or the zones needing an urgent intervention. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

We firstly define the complex notion of comfort and propose to use a hierarchical model for its representation.We then present in more detail the seating comfort by assigning value scales to its components. Our problem being a sorting problem and our data being very heterogeneous, we decide to use the ELECTRE TRI method for the aggregation of the components.

abstract={This paper develops an approach for sorting based on randomising the trichotomic decision about classifying an alternative as superior, inferior or indifferent to a certain number of profiles. The alternatives to be classified and the representative profiles are determined by performances under multiple criteria. The alternative is allocated to the category for which the probabilities of being above and below such a category are nearest to one another. A previous development in this stream is ELECTRE TRI-nC. Results of application of the new approach are compared to those obtained in a previous application of ELECTRE TRI-nC. A second analysis explores the new method when applied to a situation in which the evaluations come from a group of people instead of only one evaluator. The robustness of the approach was also tested by comparing classifications from benevolent and exacting rules. The results of application of the different rules are similar.

abstract={This work proposes and applies an approach to evaluate perceptions about the effects of Professional Master’s Degree in Engineering over the professional performance of their alumni. The proposal is based on a trichotomous outranking multicriteria method, called ELECTRE TRI (Mousseau et al., 2000). An application of the proposal has beenmade, catching the perceptions from students and professors of a Brazilian course of a Professional Master in Production Engineering, also from chiefs these students and coordinators of courses of Professional Masters of a similar range. The set of criteria was based on literature review and refined by opinions from specialists. The participants of the research were asked about their perceptions on importance degree of criteria and level of influence of the course upon the alumni’ skills, from each criterion considered in the survey. The results obtained from each group were compared. Additionally a sensibility analysis was carried on the results. © 2015 Brazilian Operations Research Society.},

abstract={This work addresses the problem of determining the most suitable sites for locating biogas plants using dairy manure as feedstock, specifically in the Entre-Douro-e-Minho Region in Portugal. A Multicriteria Spatial Decision Support System is developed to tackle this complex multicriteria decision-making problem, involving constraints and many environmental, economic, safety, and social factors. The approach followed combines the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) to manage and process spatial information with the flexibility of Multicriteria Decision Aid (MCDA) to assess factual information (e.g. soil type, slope, infrastructures) with more subjective information (e.g. expert opinion). The MCDA method used is ELECTRE TRI, an outranking-type method that yields a classification of the possible alternatives. The results of the performed analysis show that the use of ELECTRE TRI is suitable to address real-world problems of land suitability, leading towards a flexible and integrated assessment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study was undertaken on the basis of reports from international research literature, which indicates that although investments in innovation have a higher return, compared to conventional investments, any relevant information concerning those investments is not distinctly (or clearly) reported on financial statements. The absence of information regarding such investments underlines the inadequacy of financial reporting. In fact, the apparent substitution of official financial statements for other unofficial documents, perhaps even derived from unsafe sources, indicates the negative effects this absence causes on market efficiency. The consequence could be more serious to those investors that are not in the position to seek and use alternative information sources, efficiently. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficiency of the Electre Tri method in developing models for identifying innovative firms. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={It is often advisable to combine spatial representation tools such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with Multi criteria Decision Making Methods (MCDM) when solving location complex problems. The current case refers to the search for and selection of sites for onshore wind farms on the coast of the Region of Murcia, in the southeast of Spain. When resolving the proposed problem, the legal restrictions and the criteria (wind speed, area, slope, etc.) that influence the location will be considered. These will be defined in the form of thematic layers that will be entered into the GIS. Restrictions will be imposed taking into account the legislative framework of the study area so that, through their analysis and editing, it will be possible to reduce the initial area and obtain suitable sites where this type of facilities can be installed. Moreover, as the objective of the study is to select the locations and obtain a ranking two different models will be applied, initially a categorical assessment through a lexicographic order will be performed using the tools available in the GIS and, later it will be applied the ELECTRE-TRI methodology will be applied in order to make a comparison between the methods. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper deals with a real-world decision-aiding problem for zoning the risk of erosion, total suspended solids emissions, and ecological consequences of their transfers towards the streams. One of these consequences is the decrease of fishes into the streams in agricultural watersheds, because of the clogging of spawning areas. Given the multiple criteria nature of the problem, the originality of our research is to adapt a new decision-aiding sorting method, ELECTRE TRI-C, for identifying risk zones in rural areas, where measures must be taken. The developed model was applied in a small watershed (Low Normandy, France) where the objective was to assess the most appropriate intervention for protecting the reproduction habitat of the salmonid fishes. Agricultural parcels were evaluated on multiple criteria for grouping them into four risk categories, which are related to risk levels as well as priorities on the improvement works. The decision-aiding sorting model is co-constructed, within a constructive approach, through an interaction process between decision-aiding analysts, environmental experts, and local actors for improving transparency and communication on the results. This model is linked with a geographical information system (GIS) for assessing a set of criteria and the visualization of the farming parcels along with their type of intervention they should be submitted to best practices. The assignment results were validated by the environmental experts. These results have a strong impact on the agricultural practices of the farmers into the watersheds. The model proposed in this paper can be considered as a useful decision aid tool in any regions for implementing public agricultural and environmental policies for protecting the ecological areas. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The weighted sum already incorporated into a geographical information system (GIS) makes it possible to identify the best lands useful for sustainable agriculture. However, it does not allow for the inclusion of the decision makers' preferences so that a choice can be made when there are conflicts between decision makers. Because of their spatial aggregation functions, multicriteria decision analysis methods can facilitate decision making in situations where several solutions are available, various criteria have to be taken into account, and decision makers disagree about one point or another. Combinations between ArcGIS and multicriteria analysis methods in this case Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la Realité (ELECTRE TRI) and a version of the weighted sum method simple additive weighting, applicable to the vector data model, have been established. The parameters and the classification system of Food and Agriculture Organization are used in this work. This approach has been tested on the area of Mleta in Algeria. Land suitability maps for durum wheat have been produced. Through the comparison between results obtained by these two methods and those available in a classical method, based on manual overlay procedures, it appears that optimistic procedure of the ELECTRE TRI method is better suited to the problem of land suitability for agriculture. © 2013 Saudi Society for Geosciences.},

abstract={In recent years, the quest for more comprehensiveness, structure and transparency in reimbursement decision-making in healthcare has prompted the research into alternative decision-making frameworks. In this environment, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is arising as a valuable tool to support healthcare decision-making. In this paper, we present the main MCDA decision support methods (elementary methods, value-based measurement models, goal programming models and outranking models) using a case study approach. For each family of methods, an example of how an MCDA model would operate in a real decision-making context is presented from a critical perspective, highlighting the parameters setting, the selection of the appropriate evaluation model as well as the role of sensitivity and robustness analyses. This study aims to provide a step-by-step guide on how to use MCDA methods for reimbursement decision-making in healthcare. © 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract={Cities are complex systems rapidly evolving in a context of strong interweaving between problems and solutions especially in developing countries. The architectural design and the city management processes are renewed by the eruption of sustainable development. These processes are multi-scale: new geographical, temporal and political scales are emerging, calling for new tools for monitoring architectural and urban environmental changes, for implementing comprehensive plans, or for communicating between practitioners. Number of communities in developing countries has taken initiatives to develop tools based on sets of sustainability indicators. But are these tools really helpful during the architectural design or the urban management processes characterized by complexity, fussy or lacunar data, various time and space scales and multi-actors decisions? We will demonstrate in this paper, that these systems, aiming at “a posteriori” diagnosis, cannot be used directly during these fuzzy processes, especially during their early phases very critical with respect to solutions. By adjoining them multicriteria decision support techniques, they may become powerful tools for decision support. Architectural and urban designs may be evaluated using a set of weighted environmental criteria and methods to aggregate the various dimensions involved. Some Electre methods based on the comparison between pairs of solutions have been successfully used in that sense. A step further away may be performed from decision to evaluation support tools, by comparing ongoing urban designs against convolutions of systems of practitioners' values. This “value focused” approach, combined with the Electre-Tri method has been successfully integrated for evaluating the performance of urban projects, according to their distance to various user-defined systems of values. © Copyright: CEPT University, Center for Advanced Research in Building Science & Energy, Ahmedabad First Published 2014.All rights reserved.},

abstract={The paper aims to suggest a methodology able to support the analyst in the assessment process of items on the base of a criterion inspired to the maintainability parameter and in the successive assignment phase of the items in the predefined classes. The maintainability involves the continuous improvement of a system in order to improve the ability to maintain or improve the reliability of the analyzed system. In particular, the last one is the probability that a failed system will be restored to specified conditions within a given period of time when maintenance is performed according to prescribed procedures and resources. The faced case in this research regards the software maintenance, field in which the maintainability can be defined as the probability that a program will be restored to working conditions in a given period of time when it is being changed, modified or enhanced. Furthermore, the maintainability can be subdivided into diverse sub criteria as Analysability ( how easy or difficult is to diagnose the system for deficiencies or to identify the parts that need to be modified), Changeability (how easy or difficult is to make adaptations to the system), Stability (how easy or difficult is to keep the system in a consistent state during the modification process), Testability (how easy or difficult is it to test the system after modifications). Thus, with respect to aforementioned sub criteria the present research wants to propose the ELECTRE TRI method in order to assign the different analyzed items, with relation to the maintainability criterion, into the different predefined classes. With the aim to illustrate the method validity, a numerical application is shown with relation to the classification, under the maintainability criterion, of different modular Enterprise Resource Planning software systems.},

abstract={Knowledge of the strategic role of technology and information systems in organizations is of critical importance for future investments in this area. Therefore, several authors have proposed models that enable the role of information systems in organizational processes to be analyzed strategically. Given the lack of a formal model for sorting organizations with respect to the strategic positioning of information systems, this paper puts forward a multicriteria model for categorizing organizations from the categories defined by the proposed IS Strategic Impact Grid. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The model-based design of virtual fruit ideotypes using multi-objective optimisation algorithms could produce a high number of contrasted fruits. The breeder (decision-maker) will need an automatic tool allowing him/her to sort these contrasted ideotypes into predefined categories corresponding to several targeted traits. This paper aims to develop such a decision-making module to sort a set of fruit ideotypes into one of five preference-ordered categories in the context of brown rot-peach fruit pathosystem. First, a set of ideotypes with contrasted trade-off between three criteria was produced using multi-objective optimisation algorithms. Then, two multi-criteria decision-making methods (ELECTRE-Tri and DRSA: dominance-based rough set approach) were tested in order to reproduce the classification made by the decision-maker. Such a non-typical classification seemed difficult to be reproduced by the ELECTRE-TRI method while the decision rule-based method gave very good results (only 10% wrong assignments). The proposed decision-making tool is very useful to speed-up the model-based design of fruit ideotypes, i.e., breeding. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Selection of an automated inspection device for an explicit industrial application is one of the most challenging problems in the current manufacturing environment. It has become more and more complicated due to increasing complexity, advanced features and facilities that are endlessly being integrated into the devices by different manufacturers. Selection of inspection devices plays a significant role in a manufacturing system for cost effectiveness and improved productivity. This paper focuses on the application of a very popular Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) tool, i.e. ELimination and Et Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE) for solving an automated inspection device selection problem in a discrete manufacturing environment. Using a sample case study from the published literature, this paper attempts to show how different variants of the ELECTRE method, namely ELECTRE II, IS, III, IV and TRI can be suitably applied in choosing the most efficient alternative that accounts for both the decision maker's intervention and other technical elements. Using different ELECTRE methods, a list of all the possible choices from the best to the worst suitable devices is obtained while taking into account different selection attributes. The ranking performance of these methods is also compared with that of the past researchers. © IJTech 2014.},

The proposed multicriteria model is based on the ELECTRE TRI method for obtaining degrees of credibility and ratings of organizational performance. An experimental study was conducted to investigate the application of the proposed model. Rating scales, based on Likert (1932), were used and a set of criteria was inspired by the following awards for management excellence: the Deming Prize, the Malcolm Baldridge Award, the National Quality Award and European Quality Award.

abstract={This paper proposes a method for defining the levels of work in progress (WIP) in productive environments managed by constant work in process (CONWIP) policies. The proposed method combines the approaches of Computer Simulation and Electre TRI to support estimation of the adequate level of WIP and is presented in eighteen steps. The paper also presents an application example, performed on a metalworking company. The research method is based on Computer Simulation, supported by quantitative data analysis. The main contribution of the paper is its provision of a structured way to define inventories according to demand. With this method, the authors hope to contribute to the establishment of better capacity plans in production environments.},

abstract={Walkability Explorer is a software tool for the evaluation of urban walkability which, we argue, is an important aspect of the quality of life in cities. Many conventional approaches to the assessment of quality of life measure the distribution, density and distances of different opportunities in space. But distance is not all there is. To reason in terms of urban capabilities of people we should also take into account the quality of pedestrian accessibility and of urban opportunities offered by the city. The software tool we present in this paper is an user-friendly implementation of such an evaluation approach to walkability. It includes several GIS and analysis features, and is interoperable with other standard GIS and data-analysis tools. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={The assessment of the environmental sustainability of agricultural infrastructures involves the use of multiple evaluation criteria and the analysis of geographical information. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a computer system capable of assembling, storing, analysing, and displaying geographically referenced information. However, the GIS technology still suffers from several shortcomings due in large part to a lack of capable analytical capacity of supporting spatial decision problems. The most common solution for GIS to evolve into an effective tool for decision support is to couple them with operational research tools and in particular Multicriteria Decision Aid (MCDA). Due to the technological advances in the field of information systems, there is a great need to research how to integrate GIS, MCDA, the Internet, modeling and databases aiming at creating Web Multicriteria Spatial Decision Support Systems (Web MC-SDSSs). A Web MC-SDSS methodological framework is proposed for a fully integrated system of GIS and a specific MCDA method - ELECTRE TRI, through the construction of a Macro written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) in ArcGIS software. This macro interacts with a Web Algorithm Server for computing MCDA results. The developed Web MC-SDSS, named ELECTRE TRI in ArcGIS, is applied on a case study analysing the environmental sustainability of dairy farms in the Entre-Douro-e-Minho (EDM) Region. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a model to guide organizations according to the relative importance of customer's satisfaction about six quality service dimensions: reliability, empathy, assurance, tangibility, responsiveness (Parasuraman et al., 1985) and price. Design/methodology/approach: The present study uses SERVPERF customer requirements and weights of ELECTRE TRI multicriteria method to provide guidance on an appropriated action plan. Subsequently, it was demonstrated how the proposed model applied to the Inn. Findings: SERVPERF is based on the subjective and cognitive perception of customer's service analyses. ELECTRE TRI decreases the deviation of subjectivity and develops manager's energy flow, focussed on enterprise resources. Research limitations/implications: Measuring quality is hard work and usually the customer perceptions are not well understood, because it changes many times. In addition SERVPERF and ELECTRE TRI weights do not order the quality importance. Practical implications: Together, SERVPERF and ELECTRE TRI allow managers to prioritize the service level desired by the customer. Originality/value: The importance of this analysis follows the competitiveness approach: productivity, quality and flexibility (Boljwin and Kumpe, 1990). The paper develops an approach to lead organizational quality performance based on the customer view. It provides a sustainable competitive advantage. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Various software tools implementing multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods have appeared over the last decades. Although MCDA methods share common features, most of the implementing software have been developed independently from scratch. Majority of the tools have a proprietary storage format and exchanging data among software is cumbersome. Common data exchange standard would be useful for an analyst wanting to apply different methods on the same problem. The Decision Deck project has proposed to build components implementing MCDA methods in a reusable and interchangeable manner. A key element in this scheme is the XMCDA standard, a proposal that aims to standardize an XML encoding of common structures appearing in MCDA models, such as criteria and performance evaluations. Although XMCDA allows to present most data structures for MCDA models, it almost completely lacks data integrity checks. In this paper we present a new comprehensive data model for MCDA problems, implemented as an XML schema. The data model includes types that are sufficient to represent multi-attribute value/utility models, ELECTRE III/TRI models, and their stochastic extensions, and AHP. We also discuss use of the data model in algorithmic MCDA. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Multiple criteria sorting methods assign alternatives to predefined ordered categories taking multiple criteria into consideration. The Electre Tri method compares alternatives to several profiles separating the categories. Based on such comparisons, each alternative is assigned to the lowest (resp. highest) category for which it is at least as good as the lower profile (resp. is strictly preferred by the higher profile) of the category, and the corresponding assignment rule is called pessimistic (resp. optimistic). We propose algorithms for eliciting the criteria weights and majority threshold in a version of the optimistic Electre Tri rule, which raises additional difficulties w.r.t. the pessimistic rule. We also describe an algorithm that computes robust alternatives assignments from assignment examples. These algorithms proceed by solving mixed integer programs. Several numerical experiments are conducted to test the proposed algorithms on the following issues: learning ability of the algorithm to reproduce the DMs preference, robustness analysis and ability to identify conflicting preference information in case of inconsistencies in the learning set. Experiments show that eliciting the criteria weights in an accurate way requires quite a number of assignment examples. Furthermore, considering more criteria increases the information requirement. The present empirical study allows us to draw some lessons in view of practical applications of Electre Tri using the optimistic rule. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The recent figures of education in Brazil reveal poor student performance in primary and secondary education, which are the foundation of higher education. This scenario was the main motivation for the development of the exploratory approach presented in this article. Based on dimensions and criteria present in scientific studies and on the use of a method of decision support (ELECTRE TRI) and Quartiles analysis, the proposed approach aimed to evaluate and rank the quality of an institution of secondary education, according to the perceptions of faculty and students. Through a study carried out in a campus of a Federal Institute of Technology Education, Cronbach's alpha coefficient (1951) was used to measure the reliability of the questionnaires, and the Quartiles analysis was used to determine the most critical items. The results indicate that the questionnaires are valid and reliable. The learning deficit accumulated by students at previous levels of education, lack of interest in participating in classes and in deeply understanding the content of disciplines, as well as lack of homework completion are some critical items perceived by teachers. On the other hand, lack of clarity in the explanation of content of disciplines, lack of control of the class and the frequency of use of laboratories and audiovisual resources are some of the most critical items perceived by students. In developing this exploratory approach to the evaluation and diagnosis of secondary education institutes, we hope to contribute with the managers of such institutions so that precise actions to improve the quality of secondary education can be planned and carried out by official bodies.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to present a multi-criteria classification approach for identifying world climates that are favourable to light tourism. We use a multi-criteria aggregation method, Electre Tri-nC, to assign over 60000 world locations to one of four climate categories ranging from unfavourable to ideal. The motivations behind this work are to remedy to some of the methodological problems in composite indices such as the Tourism Climatic Index, where a weighted sum is computed using ordinal data. We present our results for the summer month of August on the basis of the years 1961-1990 derived from the CRU CL 1.0 climate database of New et al. (1999). In addition to being theoretically sound, our approach uses the original, virtually untransformed, continuous data thereby avoiding loss of information. It also minimizes the compensation effects and makes it possible to take into account additional criteria to cater to various tourism contexts with various decision maker profiles. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={In relation to the economic crisis, the airports were pressed from their national civil aviation authorities and from the market to lower their costs and improve their capability in organizing the supply of public facilities. Some airports reacted to this situation improving their efficiency in invoicing and collecting user charges. An enterprise that supplies different services to the Italian Aviation Authority and to several Italian companies who are airport concessionaires decided to analyse the Italian airport revenues from off-flight services, in order to compare their different results and help them improve their product offerings and identify new products' value drivers. To meet this requirement, an outranking method, ELECTRE Tri, was used to evaluate the marginal and overall activation of each Italian airport in reacting to the crisis and making profit by organizing public facilities and services that are different from the classic air navigation services on the ground. The choice of the method and the adopted procedure were motivated by the difficulties in reliable data acquisition, comparison of different and almost incomparable situations and preference elicitation, without the involvement of the actual decision makers and, in relation to a sequence of model versions, different in terms of problem structuring and parameters definition. A collaborative procedure of model structuring and incremental result analysis and several ELECTRE Tri applications, assigning each airport to a specific category, were oriented to the generation of a 'robust' model and a clear result, to read and synthesize all the information elements, understand the situation and acquire a shared vision of the problem, orient the process of information acquisition and support the definition of some improving actions. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The Region of Murcia has one of the highest percentages of potential solar radiation in Spain, which puts it in an excellent position to host electricity generation plants through photovoltaic solar systems, commonly known as solar farms. This paper proposes the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) in order to identify the best plots suitable for installing photovoltaic solar farms in the Municipality of Torre Pacheco, in the southeast of Spain. The plots are classified according to multiple evaluation aspects, by developing a multicriteria model and applying the ELECTRE-TRI method using the Decision Support System IRIS. The combination of GIS and IRIS offers the user the possibility of using the information provided by the GIS mapping leading to an assignment of the feasible courses of action (the plots) to categories of merit according to multiple, conflicting and incommensurate evaluation criteria.The GIS provides a cartographic and alphanumeric database, including two factors of distinct nature: restrictions and criteria. The restrictions are entered into the GIS using layers defined from the current legislation (urban land, undeveloped land, special protection areas for birds, community sites, infrastructures, etc.), which reduce the study area by eliminating those areas in which photovoltaic solar farms cannot be implemented. The criteria are organized into a tree to be used for assessing the greater or lesser capacity to install photovoltaic solar farms. These criteria are introduced into the GIS, taking into account weather, environmental, location, and terrain evaluation aspects. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This study proposes the use of the visual, interactive and comparative analysis (VICA) methodology to encourage consensus-building in decision making processes involving multiple criteria and multiple participants working in cooperative groups. The tool was applied to the Electre TRI (VICA-Electre TRI) method which utilises comparative analyses plus visuals and the interactive exchange of individuals' opinions within the group. It aims at reducing complexity, presenting updates about each member's progress in the decision making process and fostering the search for consensus. The methodology was implemented in a spreadsheet format (Microsoft Excel) to make it as accessible as possible while also facilitating its acceptance and efficient use within organizations. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The Human Development Index is an important indicator that evaluates well-being from the geometric mean of three dimensions: income, health and education. This indicator is often used to support decisions, but its relevance is intensified when measurements are taken at detailed levels. In this context, this study sets out to calculate the Municipal Human Development Index for 5,507 municipalities in Brazil. As a result, cities were classified into four development levels. Among Brazilian cities, 2.63% were classified as having a very high human development; 25.48% as high; 33.14% as medium; and 38.75% as low. The classification of approximately 54% of the municipalities was changed. The new approach enabled areas to be classified in a way that was more faithful to reality, without considering that half the population lives with a high quality of life. The multicriteria method ELECTRE TRI-C was used to mitigate some criticism of the index. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Spatial interpolation and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) capabilities of geographic information systems have the potential to create new approaches to forest management. In this study, the regularized spline with tension (RST) interpolation method and ELECTRE TRI MCDA was used to predict forest stand volumes in an area characterized by even-aged stands with heterogeneous structures in Turkey. Sampling data (1050 circular sample plots) were obtained from the National forest inventory. For each species and diameter class, a map of the predicted volume per ha was obtained using the RST method. By repeating the same process for the eight species occurring in the study area, 31 volume maps were produced. The accuracy of these prediction maps was assessed at pixel (20 x 20 m) and area scale (per ha). An accuracy of more than 97% was achieved at the pixel level, whereas a minimum accuracy of 86% was achieved for the area-based estimations. In addition, predicted values from the above 31 volume maps were compared with the observed values from management plan reports obtained from the Government Institute responsinble for forest management plans. The comparisons showed an accuracy of predictions of 21, 14, 4, and 2% for Calabrian pine, Oriental beech, black pine and oak species, respectively. Following interpolation, volume prediction maps were geo-computed, and a volume-based stand map was produced. The 890 different combinations of species composition and diameter classes were classified according to expert knowledge by the use of ELECTRE TRI MCDA, obtaining a final stand type map representing 70 different profile categories based on species mixture rates and diameter classes for the area analyzed. © iForest - Biogeosciences and Forestry.},

abstract={The incorporation of preferences into Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) presents some relevant advantages, namely to deal with complex real-world problems. It enables focus on the search thus avoiding the computation of irrelevant solutions from the point of view of the practical exploitation of results (thus minimizing the computational effort), and it facilitates the integration of the DM's expertise into the solution search process (thus minimizing the cognitive effort). These issues are particularly important whenever the number of conflicting objective functions and/or the number of non-dominated solutions in the population is large. In EvABOR (Evolutionary Algorithm Based on an Outranking Relation) approaches preferences are elicited from a decision maker (DM) with the aim of guiding the evolutionary process to the regions of the space more in accordance with the DM's preferences. The preferences are captured and made operational by using the technical parameters of the ELECTRE TRI method. This approach is presented and analyzed using some illustrative results of a case study of electrical networks. © 2014, IGI Global.},

abstract={This paper presents a comparative analysis of three versions of an evolutionary algorithm in which the decision maker's preferences are incorporated using an outranking relation and preference parameters associated with the ELECTRE TRI method. The aim is using the preference information supplied by the decision maker to guide the search process to the regions where solutions more in accordance with his/her preferences are located, thus narrowing the scope of the search and reducing the computational effort. An example dealing with a pertinent problem in electrical distribution network is used to compare the different versions of the algorithm and illustrate how meaningful information can be elicited from a decision maker and used in the operational framework of an evolutionary algorithm to provide decision support in real-world problems. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Data centers (DCs) are complex organizational and technical infrastructures that assure the performance and reliability of modern information and communication systems. The high installation and operations costs of DCs and the stringent requirements regarding reliability and safety require close attention to the location of this type of facility. This paper proposes a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach for identifying the most interesting locations to install sustainable DCs, taking into account technical, social, economic, and environmental dimensions. For each of these main dimensions, the evaluation was formulated as a multicriteria sorting problem. These problems were analyzed using the outranking MCDA method ELECTRE TRI through the IRIS software, allowing for uncertainty about the criteria weights. The results are summarized in a graphical form, without attempting to reduce such incommensurable dimensions to a single value. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Wood-based construction is becoming a real alternative for many types of buildings in France. This growth has entailed an extensive development of various wood types and methods in the construction industry. As a result, the design and conception of a building involve a decision with regards to the type of wood that will be used. Nonetheless, the contracting authority does not always have the tools necessary to support the choice of the best suited option. In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria modelling approach for evaluating the available alternatives using Life Cycle Analysis and Life Cycle Cost. We use a hierarchical model of values to define multi-dimensional criteria. We apply the sorting method ELECTRE-Tri B in order to aggregate the evaluations and classify the alternatives in terms of their desirability in a sustainable development context. We illustrate the workings of our approach on an example. © 2013 Sustainable Construction Materials and Technologies. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper presents an evaluation method of the state of real estate properties as a first step towards the elaboration of action plans for improving the environmental characteristics of a building stock. This multicriteria and multilevel evaluation method takes into account both the decision maker and the building specialists' point of views. One of the main challenges is in the translation of data obtained from tools such as life cycle analysis, thermal simulation or global cost analysis into high level information meaningful to the decision maker. This paper focuses on the transition mechanisms of the evaluations between the two types of actors. The proposed method is based on the comparisons of data with reference values and on multicriteria aggregation using ELECTRE TRI. We illustrate the working of the proposed method on a building stock example. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={For half a century, the significant development of intensive farming has led to a massive use of products such as pesticides. The excessive use of these substances has contaminated surface water and groundwater. Some drinking water extraction points have also had to be abandoned. Around 30 years ago, in the southwest of France, a group of farmers decided to improve their farming methods, as well as developing new best environmental practices, such as grass strips along streams and riparian forests. By combining ELECTRE TRI-C, a sorting multi-criteria model, with a GIS, we were able to assign each farming parcel to one of the five levels of risk associated with surface water pesticide contamination. We also assessed the effectiveness of best environmental practices, and found that their use led to a reduction in the risk of pesticide transfer. This methodology re-enforces decision support tools for both water resource managers and agricultural and environmental stakeholders. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Evaluating and comparing the threats and vulnerabilities associated with territorial zones according to multiple criteria (industrial activity, population, etc.) can be a time-consuming task and often requires the participation of several stakeholders. Rather than a direct evaluation of these zones, building a risk assessment scale and using it in a formal procedure permits to automate the assessment and therefore to apply it in a repeated way and in large-scale contexts and, provided the chosen procedure and scale are accepted, to make it objective. One of the main difficulties of building such a formal evaluation procedure is to account for the multiple decision makers' preferences. The procedure used in this article, Electre Tri, uses the performances of each territorial zone on multiple criteria, together with preferential parameters from multiple decision makers, to qualitatively assess their associated risk level. We also present operational tools in order to implement such a procedure in practice, and show their use on a detailed example. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Day after day, the importance of a company having an efficient storage location assignment system increases. Moreover, since products have different warehouse costs and customers' requirements are also different, it is important to sort products in order to adopt strategies for inventory management that are appropriate for each product. However, adopting a policy for each product is not applicable in the real world. Therefore, companies usually categorize products into classes and thereafter adopt specific inventory management policies. Given this situation, this paper puts forward the arguments for adopting a multi-criteria method, Electre TRI, to sort products that both considers criteria relating to the characteristics of a product as to its physical location in the warehouse and the criteria that are important for inventory strategies, such as, for example, the profitability of each unit held in storage. © 2013 Brazilian Operations Research Society.},

abstract={Generally, experts use very large quantities of data during the analysis of civil works. These data are of four main types: visual observations, monitoring data, data calculated from models, and design and construction data. They are frequently "imperfect": they contain uncertainty, imprecision, incompleteness. These imperfections have various roots, for instance, material location and sampling, number of measurement instruments, maintenance, such as scraping downstream slope, and frequency of monitoring measurement, etc. The method proposed in this paper first permits the identification of the various sources of imperfection and their definition as criteria; second, it provides a reliable way of assessing these criteria; third, it applies the multicriteria analysis ELECTRE TRI method to aggregate the values resulting from the assessment of the criteria. Finally, corrective actions are proposed to maintain or replace the measurement system under standard operating conditions. The method was applied to a real-case study. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

To this end we will work with the 2009 data from the INE (Spanish National Institute of Statistics) innovation and R&D activities surveys. To this aim, we will use the following methodology for the efficiency analysis: the one based on output oriented DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) with constant returns to scale and weight restrictions. This technique will be completed in three aspects. Firstly with the introduction of more inputs and outputs without causing an increment of efficient units. Secondly, we will use the Principal Component Analysis to extract the idea to implement the weight restrictions in the DEA. Thirdly, the analysis will be completed with a robustness Analysis of the efficient activity branches to improve the DEA discrimination capacity. © ECMS Klaus G.

abstract={Ground deformation phenomena affecting the town of Tuzla (Bosnia Herzegovina), as consequence of underground salt deposits exploitation, have been surveyed since 60 years ago. The growing of cavities beneath the town and successive surface deformations have induced several hazard factors such as ground subsidence, deep and shallow fracturing and intense groundwater table oscillations. Fortunately, this processes had no catastrophic consequences such as sinkholes developing. Previous studies analyzed the historical database of topographic and piezometric data and highlighted a cumulative subsidence rate up to 12 meters over a period spanning from the 1956 to the 2003. Fractures arose as obvious result of ground deformation and caused damages and demolitions to thousands of buildings, with almost 15,000 people evacuated. Nowadays, in order to diminish the deformation processes, a strong reduction in brine withdrawal has been introduced by the local authorities. This caused an uplift of the water table which actually makes the spatial pattern of deformation more complex. In fact, in the most urbanized area, the sinking phenomena are now turning into uplift displacements. The presence of such a hazard required an urban vulnerability assessment able to support local authorities in the forthcoming planning procedure. The vulnerability assessment of urban elements over a wide area, potentially affected by deformation phenomena, has been accomplished by an integration between GIS solutions and a multicriteria approach based on ELECTRE-TRI methodology. The vulnerability procedure is able to define a discrete map where the 50 × 50 m width elementary cells report the most vulnerable parts of the town. In particular, the ELECTRE-TRI methodology is used to combine each vulnerable urban element with the others, expressed as vector data in a geographical dataset. The multicriteria approach is performed outside the GIS environment by the ELECTRE-TRI 2.0 package and requires a preliminary rasterization of the used dataset. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={This study presents the first attempt to develop classification models for the prediction of share repurchase announcements using multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) techniques. We use three samples consisting of 434 UK firms, 330 French firms, and 296 German firms, to develop country-specific models. The MCDA techniques that are applied for the development of the models are the UTilités Additives DIScriminantes (UTADIS) and the ELimination and Choice Expressing REality (ELECTRE) TRI. We adopt a 10-fold cross validation approach, a re-sampling technique that allows us to split the datasets in training and validation sub-samples. Thus, at the first stage of the analysis the aim is the development of a model capable of reproducing the classification of the firms considered in the training samples. Once this stage is completed, the model can be used for the classification of new firms not included in the training samples (i.e. validation stage). The results show that both MCDA models achieve quite satisfactory classification accuracies in the validation sample and they outperform both logistic regression and chance predictions. The developed models could provide the basis for a decision tool for various stakeholders such as managers, shareholders, and investment analysts. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Multiple criteria sorting aims at assigning alternatives evaluated on several criteria to predefined ordered categories. In this paper, we consider a well known multiple criteria sorting method, Electre Tri, which involves three types of preference parameters: (1) category limits defining the frontiers between consecutive categories, (2) weights and majority level specifying which coalitions form a majority, and (3) veto thresholds characterizing discordance effects. We propose an elicitation procedure to infer category limits from assignment examples provided by multiple decision makers. The procedure computes a set of category limits and vetoes common to all decision makers, with variable weights for each decision maker. Hence, the method helps reaching a consensus among decision makers on the category limits and veto thresholds, whereas finding a consensus on weights is left aside. The inference procedure is based on mixed integer linear programming and performs well even for datasets corresponding to real-world decision problems. We provide an illustrative example of the use of the method and analyze the performance of the proposed algorithms. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Main decisions problems can be described into choice, ranking or sorting of a set of alternatives. The classical ELECTRE TRI (ET) method is a multicriteria-based outranking sorting method which allows to assign alternatives into a set of predetermined categories. ET method deals with situations where indifference is not transitive and solutions can sometimes appear uncomparable. ET suffers from two main drawbacks: 1) it requires an arbitrary choice of λ-cut step to perform the outranking of alternatives versus profiles of categories, and 2) an arbitrary choice of attitude for final assignment of alternatives into the categories. ET finally gives a final binary (hard) assignment of alternatives into categories. In this paper we develop a soft version of ET method based on belief functions which circumvents the aforementioned drawbacks of ET and allows to obtain both a soft (probabilistic) assignment of alternatives into categories and an indicator of the consistency of the soft solution. This Soft-ET approach is applied on a concrete example to show how it works and to compare it with the classical ET method. © 2012 ISIF (Intl Society of Information Fusi).},

abstract={Problems related to the management of construction projects are addressed in many studies. Falling behind schedule and being over budget are examples of bad results, due to the uncertainties and the dynamic environment of the construction process. This study proposes a decision model for helping project managers to focus on the main tasks of a project network during the life cycle of a project based on a MCDA (multiple criteria decision analysis) method. The model assigns priorities classes to activities in project management, taking into account several points of view. The model is based on the ELECTRE TRI-C method, which permits activities to be assigned to categories. As the environment is very dynamic, the model was built taking into consideration changes that may occur while a project is being carried out, and therefore the model must be reassessed during the project life cycle. Furthermore, the model supports a decision making environment where responsibilities are distributed amongst project team members and it brings the benefit of developing disciplines that lead to the team's greater effectiveness. An application of the model, based on a realistic situation, is presented in the context of a construction project in order to demonstrate the use of the model. The results show that by using the model, managers can improve their performance with regard to controlling project activities. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to compare sorting and ranking methods for prioritization of rehabilitation interventions of sewers, taking into account risk, performance and cost. For that purpose multiple criteria decision-aid (MCDA) methods such as ELECTRE TRI for sorting and ELECTRE III for ranking are applied in a real case-study and the results obtained are compared. The case study is a small sanitary sewer system from a Portuguese utility located in the metropolitan area of Lisbon. The problem to investigate is the prioritization of the sewer candidates for rehabilitation. The decision maker (a panel group of specialists) has chosen five assessment measures: water level and maximum flow velocity (hydraulic performance indices), sewer importance and failure repair cost (collapse-related consequences of failure) and the risk of collapse. The results show that the outcomes from ELECTRE III are easier to understand than those from ELECTRE TRI method. Two different sets of weights were used, and the sorting and ranking results from both methods were found to be sensitive to them. ELECTRE TRI method is not straightforward as it involves technical parameters that are difficult to de fine, such as reference profiles and cut levels. © IWA Publishing 2012.},

abstract={A multi-criteria model tackled by an outranking method devoted to the sorting problem is presented to support decision making in assessing individual mental disabilities using information required in the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. This diagnosis process is a critical factor for adapting treatments to the current stage of the disease and improving health care and quality of life. The criteria required in the Clinical Dementia Rating scale have been considered as an input for developing our multi-criteria model, the output of which is the classification of each individual under evaluation in a pre-defined ordered class (category) as an indicator of the revealed level of mental disabilities. A method based on the exploitation of an outranking relation for the sorting problem is used to compare the individual information according to multiple evaluation criteria with reference profiles (specified standards) that define the boundaries of the classes. This methodological approach is substantially different from the ones based on the aggregation of the different criteria using weighted-sums to produce a "common value" measure. The method requires meaningful technical parameters, such as weights (herein perceived as true importance coefficients of the multiple evaluation aspects), distinct thresholds to ascertain the outranking classification, and a cutting level establishing the exigency of the classification. A realistic example using the decision support system Iris is presented to illustrate the results.},

abstract={Main decision-making problems can be described into choice, ranking or sorting of a set of alternatives or solutions. The principle of Electre TRI (ET) method is to sort alternatives ai according to criteria g j into categories C h whose lower and upper limits are respectively b h and b h+1. The sorting procedure is based on the evaluations of outranking relations based firstly on calculation of partial concordance and discordance indexes and secondly on global concordance and credibility indexes. In this paper, we propose to replace the calculation of the original concordance and discordance indexes of ET method by a more effective sigmoidal model. Such model is part of a new Belief Function ET (BF-ET) method under development and allows a comprehensive, elegant and continuous mathematical representation of degree of concordance, discordance and the uncertainty level which is not directly taken into account explicitly in the classical Electre Tri. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Problems encountered in the context of the maintenance management of water supply are evidenced by the lack of decision support models which gives a manager overview of the system. This paper, therefore, develops a model that uses, in its framework, the multicriteria outranking method ELECTRE TRI. The objective is to sort the areas of water flow measurement of a water distribution network, by priority of maintenance, with data collected from an automated system of abnormalities detection. This sorting is designed to support maintenance decisions in terms of the measure more appropriate to be applied per region. To illustrate the proposed model, an application was performed in a city with 100 thousand water connections. With this model it becomes possible to improve the allocation of maintenance measures for regions and mainly to improve the operation of the distribution network. © 2012 Brazilian Operations Research Society.},

abstract={Due to constant decrease in farmlands, it is important to identify the best lands useful for sustainable agriculture (productive and profitable agriculture that protects the environment and that is socially equitable). This requirement has resulted in the development of land suitability maps for agriculture by combining several factors of various natures and of differing importance. The integration of MultiCriteria Decision Analysis approaches (MCDA) in a Geographical Information System (GIS) provides a powerful spatial decision support system which offers the opportunity to efficiently produce these land suitability maps. Indeed, GIS is a powerful tool for analyzing spatial data and establishing a process for decision support. Because of their spatial aggregation functions, MCDA methods can facilitate decision making in situations where several solutions are available, various criteria have to be taken into account and decision-makers are in conflict (Dias et al., 2002). The parameters and the classification system used in this work are inspired from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) approach dedicated to a sustainable agriculture. A spatial decision support system has been developed for establishing the land suitability map for agriculture. It incorporates the multicriteria analysis method ELECTRE Tri (ELimitation Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) in a GIS (ArcGIS) within the GIS program package environment. This approach has been tested on the area of Mleta in Algeria. A land suitability map for durum wheat has been produced. Through the obtained results, it appears that ELECTRE Tri method, integrated into ArcGIS 9.2 of ESRI, is better suited to the problem of land suitability for agriculture. The time saving during the development of the land suitability map for the agriculture of the durum wheat was considerable. The coherence of the obtained maps confirms the system effectiveness. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents Electre Tri-nC, a new sorting method which takes into account several reference actions for characterizing each category. This new method gives a particular freedom to the decision maker in the co-construction decision aiding process with the analyst to characterize the set of categories, while there is no constraint for introducing only one reference action as typical of each category like in Electre Tri-C (Almeida-Dias et al.; 2010). As in such a sorting method, this new sorting method is composed of two joint rules. Electre Tri-nC also fulfills a certain number of natural requirements. Additional results on the behavior of the new method are also provided in this paper, namely the ones with respect to the addition or removal of the reference actions used for characterizing a certain category. A numerical example illustrates the manner in which Electre Tri-nC can be used by a decision maker. A comparison with some related sorting procedures is presented and it allows to conclude that the new method is appropriate to deal with sorting problems. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Evaluating and comparing the threats and vulnerabilities associated with territorial zones according to multiple criteria (industrial activity, population, etc.) can be a time-consuming task and often requires the participation of several experts and decision makers. Rather than a direct evaluation of these zones, building a risk evaluation scale and using it in a formal procedure permits to automate the assessment and therefore to apply it in a repeated way and in large-scale contexts and, provided the chosen procedure and scale are accepted, to make it objective. One of the main difficulty of building such a formal evaluation procedure is to account for the multiple experts knowledge and decision makers preferences. The procedure used in this article, ELECTRE TRI, uses the performances of each territorial zone onmultiple criteria, together with preferential parameters, to qualitatively assess their associated risk level. The preferential parameters to be determined are the category limits, i.e. the limits on each criterion of the performance range associated with a given risk level, and the weights associated with the different criteria. To obtain these parameters with no direct questioning of the stakeholders, tools based on mathematical programming have been developed to deduce these preferential parameters from assessment examples. In this article, several such tools are applied together in order to build a complete example leading to the definition of a territorial risk evaluation scale taking into account the preferences of multiple stakeholders. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Multiple Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) aims at helping a Decision Maker (DM) in the representation of his preferences over a set of alternatives, on the basis of several criteria which are often contradictory. In addition to the presence of a DM, MCDA process requires a specification of criteria, alternatives and preferential information given by the DM. Hence many methods have been developed in order to solve MCDA problems (ELECTRE methods, AHP, etc.). The interconnexion between MCDA and risk analysis has been proved. MCDA methods can be used to solve risk analysis problems such as: • Computation of a risk scale: it can be done by using MCDA methods as ELECTRE TRI or by MACBETH methodology when the scale is quantitative; • The evaluation of remediation solutions after an accident. We present in this paper the Decision Deck (DD) project (http://www.decision-deck.org/) which aims at collaboratively developing Open Source software tools implementing MCDA. These tools constitute an open source platform available for all communities, not only for MCDA community. We show how MCDA methods implemented in Decision Deck can be useful for risk analysis, especially in risk assessment and remediation risk management. Thus, Decision Deck can be interpreted as a bridge between MCDA and riskanalysis. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.},

The proposal is based on a trichotomous outranking multicriteria method ELECTRE TRI, reported in [1]. An application of the proposal has been made, catching the perceptions from students of a class of a Brazilian Professional Master's Degree Course in Production Engineering. The criteria set was first based on literature review and refined trough opinions from specialists. The participants of the research were asked about their perceptions on both: Importance degree of criteria and influence of the course over alumni's skill under each criterion viewpoint. The data collected were analyzed with the support of ELECTRE TRI and a sensibility analyses on the influence of the ELECTRE TRI's credibility degree cut-level was carried over the results and assignments.},

abstract={Levees are large alignment civil engineering works with a performance that is assessed with great difficulty due to its longitudinal variability. We hereby suggest that a decision-making support procedure should be identified, built and implemented so as to split levee alignments into homogeneous sections and identify them according to their performance level. Our work is focused on defining actions for the purpose of solving the decision-making problem with regard to large alignment works. In order to select a suitable decision-making method, we suggest a formulation and a comparison between two types of multi-criteria methods: the ELECTRE TRI outranking method and a unicriterion method. The relevance of building a unicriterion for the purpose of our study is investigated considering the existing operational interconnections between the levee evaluation criteria. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Since its conception ELECTRE TRI has been widely used to deal with several problems in the problematic of sorting. However, the inherent limitation of this method lies in its working with only one decision-maker. Currently there is an ELECTRE TRI version that can be used with multiple decision-makers, but it lacks the tools to deal with non-cooperative situations. Thus, this paper puts forward a negotiation procedure to be applied when using ELECTRE TRI. The procedure was inspired by the last-diminisher procedure and a version of the Nash Demand Game, Divide-the-Dollar, in order to establish an envy-free Nash Equilibrium and to control greed. The method establishes a negotiation process between decision-makers, in order to define each player’s degree of participation in determining the values of the ELECTRE TRI criteria, weights and parameters. Each parameter is divided into negotiable shares that will be distributed by means of the negotiation procedure, which represents the degree of participation of the decision-maker’s preferences. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={A very common situation within army is the formation of teams, either ad hoc or permanent and the assignment of staff into them based on a number of predefined criteria. In practice, the assignment of each staff member into a specific team or group is held manually and results into a time consuming task which is also not error free. In this work an initial methodological approach for the military staff assignment problem is presented. The approach is the utilization of multicriteria analysis to assign staff into a number of categories according to predefined criteria. The Electre Tri method has been used for the proposed model which is capable of handling decision problems with multiple criteria. The overall approach is introduced along with an illustration example.},

abstract={Multicriteria sorting methods aim at assigning alternatives to one of the predefined ordered categories. We consider a sorting method in which categories are defined by profiles separating consecutive categories. An alternative a is assigned to the lowest category for which a is at least as good as the lower profile of this category, for a majority of weighted criteria. This method, that we call MR-Sort, corresponds to a simplified version of ELECTRE Tri. To elicit the values for the profiles and weights, we consider a learning procedure. This procedure relies on a set of known assignment examples to find parameters compatible with these assignments. This is done using mathematical programming techniques. The focus of this study is experimental. In order to test the mathematical formulation and the parameters learning method, we generate random samples of simulated alternatives. We perform experiments in view of answering the following questions: (a) assuming the learning set is generated using a MR-Sort model, is the learning method able to restore the original sorting model? (b) is the learning method able to do so even when the learning set contains errors? (c) is MR-Sort model able to represent a learning set generated with another sorting method, i.e. can the models be discriminated on an empirical basis? © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The paper focuses on portfolio selection problems which aim at selecting a subset of alternatives considering not only the performance of the alternatives evaluated on multiple criteria, but also the performance of portfolio as a whole, on which balance over alternatives on specific attributes is required by the Decision Makers (DMs). We propose a two-level method to handle such decision situation. First, at the individual level, the alternatives are evaluated by the sorting model Electre Tri which assigns alternatives to predefined ordered categories by comparing alternatives to profiles separating the categories. The DMs' preferences on alternatives are expressed by some assignment examples they can provide, which reduces the DMs' cognitive efforts. Second, at the portfolio level, the DMs' preferences express requirements on the composition of portfolio and are modeled as constraints on category size. The method proceeds through the resolution of a Mixed Integer Program (MIP) and selects a satisfactory portfolio as close as possible to the DMs' preference. The usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated by an example which integrates a sorting model with assignment examples and constraints on the portfolio definition. The method can be used widely in portfolio selection situation where the decision should be made taking into account the performances of individual alternatives and portfolio simultaneously. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In this paper, ELECTRE-TRI method has been used for ranking the optimal solutions of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) which has been developed for multi-objective operation optimization of a cascade system of reservoirs. In the multi-objective optimization model, flood control and water supply have been considered as short-term and long-term objectives, respectively. The flood control objective function has been formulated to minimize the expected flood damages in different flooding months. A short-term reservoir optimization model which provides the optimal hourly releases during floods has been developed and linked to a flood damage estimation model. The water supply objective function minimizes water deficit damages in agricultural areas. The losses associated with deficit in supplying agricultural water demands have been calculated based on crop yield responses to deficit irrigation. Selection of the most practical solution among the optimal Pareto set of solutions, which is addressed using ELECTRE-TRI method, is a challenging issue. The proposed methodology provides an opportunity for further incorporation of decision makers' preferences in ranking the NSGA-II optimal set of solutions. The results of applying the developed models to the cascade system of the Dez and Bakhtiari Reservoirs in southwest of Iran show that ELECTRE-TRI method has the ability to rank the non-dominated solutions of the multi-objective operation optimization model and provides a suitable framework for considering the preferences of decision makers (DMs). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The three Rio Conventions-the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification-face the challenge to create synergies at different levels. The objective of this article is to describe how we have assessed synergies between the Rio Conventions at the project level in the forest sector. Since the complexity of the decision problem is high, we adopted the Multicriteria Decision Aid approach, which can provide a broad insight into the decision problem and find a compromise solution to a problem with multidimensional and conflicting criteria including social, economic and environmental features. The ELECTRE TRI model was used for assessing synergies at the project level, and has been a useful tool to quantify the performance of afforestation and reforestation projects into three categories (synergistic, reasonably synergistic, and not synergistic). For the first time, afforestation and reforestation projects have been assessed in a comprehensive way through decision criteria that reflect global and local interests using a non-compensatory multicriteria method. © 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract={This research considers decision situations in which a portfolio of individuals is to be selected. Criteria relative to quality of individuals conflict with constraints on the composition of the group. This work applies to student selection problems in which the group criteria conflict with the constraints relative to the student portfolio. In this chapter, we propose an innovative methodology to support such a decision. In the first step, the Electre Tri method sorts students into ordered predefined categories according to how each student individually fulfills the selection requirements; in a second analysis, a mathematical programming formulation combines the results of the first step with the requirements on the student group to select a group of students who are individually good and satisfactory as a group. The methodology identifies a portfolio of students that is a good compromise between group constraints and the Electre Tri student classification. Although this new methodology is applied in the context of student selection, it can be applied widely in other multicriteria portfolio decision contexts. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

abstract={We introduce a novel anomaly intrusion detection method based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). This approach searches for those vectors in the underlying space that best discriminate among users' profile classes. The discrimination rules are based on linear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply LDA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes. Thus one can easily determine if a new student is legitimate or not by projecting its profile onto the profile subspace. Simulations show that our approach outperforms both Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Electre Tri methods. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Objective: The aim of this paper is to apply an informatics tool for dealing with a medical decision aiding problem to help infertile couples to become parents, when using assisted reproduction. Methods: A multiple criteria decision aiding method for sorting or ordinal classification problems, called Electre Tri-C, was chosen in order to assign each couple to an embryo-transfer category. The set of categories puts in evidence a way for increasing the single pregnancy rate, while minimizing multiple pregnancies. The decision aiding sorting model was co-constructed through an interaction process between the decision aiding analysts and the medical experts. Results: According to the sample used in this study, the Electre Tri-C method provides a unique category in 86% of the cases and it achieves a sorting accuracy of 61%. Retrospectively, the medical experts do agree that some of their judgments concerning the number of embryos to transfer back to the uterus of the woman could be different according to these results. The current ART methodology achieves a single pregnancy rate of 47% and a twin pregnancy rate of 14%. Thus, this informatics tools may play an important role for supporting ART medical decisions, aiming to increase the single pregnancy rate, while minimizing multiple pregnancies. Limitations: Building the set of criteria comprises a part of arbitrariness and imperfect knowledge, which require time and expertise to be refined. Among them, three criteria are modeled by means of a holistic classification procedure by the medical experts. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={Many companies are engaged in increasing their productivity and improving the quality of their products and operations. A means to achieve such improvements is to adopt Business Process Management practices. Techniques to analyze, evaluate and improve business processes are deemed Business Process Modeling. Currently, there are several methodologies and techniques for modeling to choose from. The business process modeling method selected for modeling can directly impact on the result of BPM. Therefore, in order to help both academics and practitioners, a model is proposed that will sort business process modeling methods based on the objectives of modeling using the ELECTRE TRI method. This model can serve as a basis for evaluating modeling methods, and thus act as a guide for organizations and serve for a pre-analysis that may support future choice. We use a Product Development process in an automobile company as an example to demonstrate the model. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={A new approach for using the preferences elicited from a Decision Maker (DM) into the operational framework of an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is presented. The preference representation is achieved using the parameters and principles of the ELECTRE TRI method devoted to the sorting problem. The outranking relation is used to replace the non-dominance relation in the usual operators in the EA (crossover, mutation and selection operator). The aim of this approach is to focus the search on the region of interest defined by the DM's preferences and consequently restrict the number of solutions in the Pareto-optimal front to be subject to further screening. This aspect is particularly important when dealing with problems that lead to a large number of non-dominated solutions. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a new sorting method, following a decision aiding constructive approach, is proposed. This method is called Electre Tri-C. As a sorting method, a set of categories must be defined to represent the way in which the actions that are going to be assigned to each of them should further be processed. This method is appropriate to deal with decision aiding contexts where the categories are completely ordered and each of them is defined through a single characteristic reference action. The set of characteristic actions should be co-constructed through an interactive process between the analyst and the decision maker. Electre Tri-C has been conceived to verify a set of natural structural requirements (conformity, homogeneity, monotonicity, and stability), which can be viewed as its fundamental properties. This method is composed of two joint rules, called descending rule and ascending rule, which must be used conjointly (and not separately). Each one of these rules selects only one category or a range of possible categories for a possible assignment of an action. This assignment depends on the comparison of such an action to the characteristic actions according to a chosen credibility level. Numerical examples are also presented in order to illustrate the main theoretical results provided by the method. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Land-use planning, as concerns the prevention and limitation of the consequences of possible major accidents from industrial installations, is an essential mechanism for dealing with actual or potential conflicts between sources of risk, such as potentially hazardous industrial developments, and surrounding land-uses. The objective of this paper is to present a decision making methodology that is suitable for assisting urban and spatial planning in the vicinity of hazardous installations and therefore covers the directions of Article 12 of the European Council Directive 96/82/EC (the so-called SEVESO II directive). The proposed methodology was designed to address the particularities of the Greek case, regarding the type and availability of risk and spatial data. It incorporates a broad set of multiple and conflicting criteria that arise in land-use planning decisions, through the application of a well known multi-criteria decision analysis method (ELECTRE TRI). Additionally, it is easy to use (comprised of simple steps) and can be readily incorporated into Geographical Information System based platforms. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper proposes a multicriteria model for assessing risk in natural gas pipelines, and for classifying sections of pipeline into risk categories. The model integrates Utility Theory and the ELECTRE TRI method. It aims to help transmission and distribution companies, when engaged in risk management and decision-making, to consider the multiple dimensions of risk that may arise from pipeline accidents. Pipeline hazard scenarios are presented, and it is argued that the assessment of risk in natural gas pipelines should not be based solely on probabilities of human fatalities, but should involve a wider perspective that simultaneously takes into consideration the human, environmental and financial dimensions of impacts of pipeline accidents. Finally, in order to verify the effectiveness of the model set out, a numerical application based on a real case study is presented. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper we consider the idea of negotiations conducted by means of the software support tools. We present the advantages of the negotiation support systems discussing their different functions and typologies focusing later on the possibilities of decision support they can give to the negotiating parties in all negotiation phases. After presenting the most popular solutions we introduce also two of our own procedures that can be applied in the pre-negotiation phase for eliciting negotiators' preferences and building the offers' scoring systems for the parties. The first one is based on the Hammond, Keeney and Raiffa's procedure of even swaps, while the second derives from the Roy's ELECTRE-TRI. Both of them can be easily applied as the analytic engines in electronic negotiation systems replacing the classical additive scoring systems. We discuss also the issue of using different scoring systems in the successive negotiation phases.},

abstract={The resolution of a multi-objective optimization problem involves not just a search and computation phase, capable of providing a representative sample of the Pareto-optimal front, but also a decision support process to aid the Decision Maker (DM) to progress in the learning of the trade-offs at stake in different regions of the search space. This is accomplished by integrating in the search process the DM's preferences to guide the search and limit both the cognitive effort, in assessing Pareto-optimal solutions with distinct characteristics, and the computational effort, by reducing the scope of the search according to the preferences expressed by the DM. The introduction of meaningful preference expression parameters used in the ELECTRE TRI method for sorting problems in the framework of an evolutionary algorithm is proposed. Illustrative results in an operational planning problem in electricity networks are reported. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Outranking methods constitute an important class of multicriteria classification models. Often, however, their implementation is cumbersome, due to the large number of parameters that the decision maker must specify. Past studies tried to address this issue using linear and nonlinear programming, to elicit the necessary preferential information from assignment examples. In this study, an evolutionary approach, based on the differential evolution algorithm, is proposed in the context of the ELECTRE TRI method. Computational results are given to test the effectiveness of the methodology and the quality of the obtained models. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Robustness analysis and visualization are two of key concepts of multi-criteria decision support. They enable the decision-maker to improve his understanding of both the model and the problem domain. A class of original mathematical optimization based robustness metrics is hence defined in this paper. In addition, several efficient existing techniques that have been successfully used in various ICT projects are presented. They include the stability intervals/regions and the principal components analysis. All approaches are applied to the multi-attribute utility function, and to the PROMETHEE II and ELECTRE TRI methods. Their benefits are discussed and demonstrated on real life cases.},

abstract={This paper performs an assessment of 41 agricultural biogas plants located in Austria to determine their relative performance in terms of economic, environmental, and social criteria and corresponding indicators. The comparison of these renewable energy conversion plants is based on two complementary analyses. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was conducted to provide measures of radial efficiency relative to the observed frontier of production possibilities. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), using the IRIS/ELECTRE TRI methodology, was conducted to obtain a different perspective on the results, and as a tool that would enable to incorporate managerial preferences easily. To be able to use IRIS while keeping the spirit behind DEA, the evaluation criteria were defined as different output/input efficiency ratios, and no information about criteria weights was introduced at the outset. The results suggest that MCDA, and the use of IRIS in particular, constitutes a useful approach that can be applied in a complementary way to DEA. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Sewer networks represent an important asset that requires good management according to a long-term integrated policy, which should take into account the state of sewer pipes, their environment, and budgeting constraints. In this scope, a good knowledge of the asset stock ensured by an inventory and data gathering is necessary. The asset considered in this article is the sewer pipes, with a diameter of less than 1200 mm. The state of the sewers is assessed according to closed circuit television (CCTV) inspections obtained by special cameras. The inspections allow us to describe the state of pipes according to observed defects, but do not give a tool for decision aiding for rehabilitation or renewal. In order to exploit available data for help in decision-making, we propose to use the methodology defined in the French project for rehabilitation of sewer networks RERAU (2000-2004) that suggests defining a set of dysfunction indicators according to observed defects following CCTV inspections. We use the defined dysfunctions as decision criteria with the help of the multicriteria approach Electre-tri for implementing the sorting procedure of sewers into specific categories according to their state of deterioration. Our study was achieved on a sample of sewer pipes in Alsace, France. The current paper details the approach for sorting the sewers and defining guidelines for the categorization of sewers according to their level of deterioration.},

abstract={The Piedmont Region Financial Institute has had to construct a procedure and a system to monitor projects that a regional law has financed. In this context, the integration of a new data reading approach in a monitoring procedure has been proposed and a multi-criteria decision aiding method, ELECTRE TRI, has been applied to the problem, first to explain a possible use of the acquired information and then to be integrated in the information system. The Model base of the prototype system was used, as a shared space and a common framework, to better understand the aims and information needs of the monitoring process and therefore to read data and orient information acquisition. The application of ELECTRE TRI to the models analytically synthesizes the information elements, to face the difficulties of the monitoring process in its different phases and to support decisions, in terms of modifications and integrations of activities for future law applications. © 2009, IGI Global.

abstract={The increase in productivity is an obvious objective for business, moreover with the research and development objectives set out for Barcelona 2010 and the Lisbon Summit. Productivity is linked to efficiency as enterprises have increased productivity when they need less input to achieve certain outputs or when they increase outputs with the same inputs. The objective for this article is to analyze the innovation efficiency in Spain by activity branch. To this end we will work with the 2006 data from the INE (Spanish National Institute of Statistics) innovation and R&D activities surveys. To this aim, we will use the following methodology for the efficiency analysis: the one based on output oriented DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) with constant returns to scale. This technique will be completed in two aspects. Firstly with the introduction of more inputs and outputs without causing an increment of efficient units and, secondly the study will be completed with a robust analysis to improve the DEA discrimination capacity. © ECMS.},

To this end the research has been based on the data analysis from the INE (Spanish National Institute of Statistics) Innovation surveys from 2005 to 2006. The methodology used will allow us to set up an Autonomous Regions Ranking per year, clustering per groups of innovation quality, so we could analyze the evolution of these rankings to reveal the existence of downward/upward trend changes during the period analyzed in the different Spanish Autonomous Regions. It will be set out having into consideration all the data and variables offered by the INE at Autonomous Region level on the enterprise technological innovation survey, so it will be analyzed among other variables the intensity of innovation, the number of innovative enterprises and the number of innovative SMEs. Those classifications will be obtained throughout the application of a non compensatory multicriteria methodology based on outranking relations: Electre Tri method. © ECMS.},

abstract={The paper includes description of the main elements of a decision support system (DSS) for positioning enterprises according to assessment of their competences. An enterprise model created according to original conception of defining features is presented. In the author’s conception, it is assumed that the enterprise competence system is the object which is assessed. The system is assessed from two points of view: assessment of competence potential and assessment of competence gap. A procedure of making assessment in the ranges determined by the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) method is depicted. A procedure of explanation of the enterprise position based on an adaptation of the EUCLID and ELECTRE TRI methods is given. Results of research on the SME sector in south-east Poland are presented. These results lead to distinguishing four classes of assessment of enterprise positions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.},

abstract={Under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), sustainable development is considered a country context-specific aspect which differs across countries. Actual CDM practice has shown that projects are largely initiated by the demand for relatively low-cost certified emission reductions, leading to a series of ad-hoc projects, rather than serving the overall host countries' sustainable development needs and priorities. In the above framework, the study aims to direct CDM towards national sustainable development priorities, through the identification of sustainable energy technology priorities for electricity generation in five examined developing countries, namely Chile, China, Israel, Kenya and Thailand. The current approach lays emphasis on the formulation of the process so as to be relatively straightforward to incorporate direct experts' preferences as well as trying to deal with the needs of flexibility and validity, through the use of an existing Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method, namely the Electre TRI method. © 2009 International Energy Initiative.},

abstract={Regulation of pesticides in agricultural sector is becoming increasingly oriented to the use of best management practices in order to counter the effect of agricultural practices on health and groundwater. Several distinct criteria (economic, technical, environmental, social and informational criteria) need to be considered in the decision-making process. Moreover, the preferences of actors can vary according to the different management strategies and vested interests. In considering this context, a regional survey has been conducted in order to collect information on IPM opportunity. IPM is a pesticides management system which helps to solve pest problems while reducing environmental damage and increasing productivity. In conjunction with this regional survey, a multicriteria approach has been applied in order to help the decision-making process. ELECTRE-tri has been used and IPM opportunity evaluated from the results of the national survey and a critical review. Above all, key factors and impediments concerning the implementation of IPM have been identified. copyright © 2009 inderscience enterprises ltd.},

abstract={We consider the problem of assigning alternatives evaluated on several criteria into ordered categories C1, C2,..., C p. This problem is known as the multi-criteria sorting problem and arises in many situations such as classifying countries into different risk levels based on economical and socio-political criteria, evaluating credit applications of bank customers. We are interested in sorting methods that are grounded on the construction of outranking relations. Among these, the Electre Tri method requires defining multidimensional profiles that represent the "frontier" separating consecutive categories Ch and C h+1, and assigns an alternative to categories according to how it compares to each of the profiles. The explicit specification of the profiles of consecutive categories can be difficult for decision makers. We develop a new outranking based sorting method that does not require the explicit definition of profiles. We instead require the decision maker to assign a subset of reference alternatives to the categories. To assign the remaining alternatives, each such alternative is compared to reference alternatives, and assigned to categories accordingly. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={ELECTRE TRI is a multiple criteria decision aiding sorting method with a history of successful real-life applications. In ELECTRE TRI, values for certain parameters have to be provided. We propose a new method, SMAA-TRI, that is based on stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA), for analyzing the stability of such parameters. The stability analysis can be used for deriving robust conclusions. SMAA-TRI allows ELECTRE TRI to be used with uncertain, arbitrarily distributed values for weights, the lambda cutting level, and profiles. The method consists of analyzing finite spaces of arbitrarily distributed parameter values. Monte Carlo simulation is applied in this in order to describe for each alternative the share of parameter values that have it assigned to different categories. We show the real-life applicability by re-analyzing a case study in the field of risk assessment. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The article concerns the most important issues brought up while executing self-compacting based build-in concrete constructions. The planning process has been divided into five stages: formwork system selection, working sections split up, outlays' calculation, scheduling and quality assessment. Each of the stages depends on various criteria, which have been clearly stated and described. Lateral formwork pressure of SCC mix and the problem of casting rate has not been disobeyed. The article comes up with possible solutions or solutions' concepts for the problems that arise during the planning process. They involve multi-criteria selection ELECTRE TRI method, scheduling method for optimization of formwork allocation and Monte Carlo simulations for schedule.},

abstract={This work proposes a Progressive Assisted Sorting Algorithm (PASA) based on a multicriteria evaluation ELECTRE-type method. The purpose of the PASA is to aid a decision maker to progressively sort a set of alternatives into a set of categories, which we considered are ordered (ordinal sorting), following a consistency principle. We consider the principle that if an alternative outranks (is as good as) a second one, then it must belong to the same category or to a better category. The set of alternatives already sorted by the decision maker will implicitly define the categories, and will constrain the range of categories where other alternatives may be sorted. We show how the same idea may be used in an aggregation/disaggregation approach, considering some parameters of ELECTRE are not fixed a priori, but are constrained only by the examples provided. In this context, we establish a "convex-shape property" stating that the range of possible categories for an alternative is always an interval of categories. A discussion contrasting this approach with ELECTRE TRI is included in the conclusions. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={This paper proposes a multi-criteria decision approach for sorting energy-efficiency initiatives, promoted by electric utilities, with or without public funds authorized by a regulator, or promoted by an independent energy agency, overcoming the limitations and drawbacks of cost-benefit analysis. The proposed approach is based on the ELECTRE-TRI multi-criteria method and allows the consideration of different kinds of impacts, although avoiding difficult measurements and unit conversions. The decision is based on all the significant effects of the initiative, both positive and negative, including ancillary effects often forgotten in cost-benefit analysis. The ELECTRE-TRI, as most multi-criteria methods, provides to the decision maker the ability of controlling the relevance each impact can have on the final decision in a transparent way. The decision support process encompasses a robustness analysis, which, together with a good documentation of the parameters supplied into the model, should support sound decisions. The models were tested with a set of real-world initiatives and compared with possible decisions based on cost-benefit analysis. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The Piedmont Region Financial Institute has had to construct a procedure and a system to monitor projects that a regional law has financed. In this context, the integration of a new data reading approach in a monitoring procedure has been proposed and a multi-criteria decision aiding method, ELECTRE TRI, has been applied to the problem, first to explain a possible use of the acquired information and then to be integrated in the information system. The Model base of the prototype system was used, as a shared space and a common framework, to better understand the aims and information needs of the monitoring process and therefore to read data and orient information acquisition. The application of ELECTRE TRI to the models analytically synthesizes the information elements, to face the difficulties of the monitoring process in its different phases and to support decisions, in terms of modifications and integrations of activities for future law applications. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

Next, the focus is on defining procedures for case indexing. The procedures are based on multiple-criteria methods supporting a decision-making process, such as EUCLID and ELECTRE TRI. The indexing procedures form also a knowledge transformation cycle (from implicit to explicit knowledge) known as externalization. The author developed a subsystem, which supports the implementation of this cycle. The UML diagrams show the structure of the SOK-P1 subsystem. The author developed an ontology of enterprise assessment. The subsystem presented uses the taxonomies of the enterprise potential and business risks, as well as thesauruses, which are a set of suggestions for assessors. © 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Employees must acquire new competences and qualifications throughout their lives, in order to be able to deal with the multiple changes in the labour market. The specific knowledge and competences, acquired either formally or non-formally, must be recognized so that they can be transferred and utilized. The existing titles of studies and accreditation mechanisms do not generally cover this need. This paper aims to propose an integrated approach for the evaluation of information technology knowledge and skills, regardless of where and how they have been acquired, so as to apply a continuous education and training policy. The proposed multicriteria methodology for the evaluation of qualifications and skills concerns candidates wishing to be accredited in an information technology specialization or profession. The methodology refers to the evaluation of the professional experience, studies and vocational training of the candidates for accreditation. It contains the analysis and modelling of the qualitative criteria as well as the implementation of multicriteria aggregation-disaggregation techniques attributing value to each criterion. Then, the candidates are classified in categories of professionals using the Electre Tri method, accepting as input data the multicriteria assessments on each criterion. The proposed evaluation approach has been adapted to the Greek educational system and is applied to a specific example of candidate. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article provides an overview of a multicriteria decision support methodology for annual rehabilitation programs of water networks. A first set of criteria is formulated for the purpose of comparing and ranking rehabilitation projects. Each proposed criterion is a measure of a particular impact of the condition of a pipe. The ELECTRE TRI method is implemented for defining rehabilitation priorities. Two reference profiles are used to define the limits of three categories associated with three increasing priority levels. With these two reference profiles, applying the ELECTRE TRI method to an asset stock (a set of pipes that are candidates for rehabilitation) means assigning each pipe to one of six possible priority groups. A second set of criteria, based on the concept of efficiency, is proposed for comparing alternative rehabilitation programs (subsets of the asset stock). © 2007 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.},

abstract={ELECTRE TRI is a multiple criteria decision aiding sorting method with a history of successful real-life applications. ELECTRE TRI requires as input several parameters, such as criteria weights, thresholds, category profiles, and lambda cutting level. We propose the SMAA-TRI method for analyzing the stability of ELECTRE TRI analysis and for deriving robust conclusions. SMAA-TRI is based on Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA), and it allows ELECTRE TRI to be used with imprecise, arbitrarily distributed values for weights and the lambda cutting level. The method computes for each alternative action the share of parameter values that have it assigned to different categories. We list some potential military applications. To demonstrate SMAA-TRI, we re-analyze a case study in the field of risk assessment and management. © 2007 Springer.},

abstract={In the literature on MCDM, many methods have been proposed in order to sort alternatives evaluated on several attributes into ordered categories. Most of them were proposed on an ad hoc basis. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a recent trend of research aiming at giving these methods sound theoretical foundations. Using tools from conjoint measurement, we provide an axiomatic analysis of the partitions of alternatives into two categories that can be obtained using what we call "noncompensatory sorting models". These models have strong links with the pessimistic version of ELECTRE TRI. Our analysis allows to pinpoint what appears to be the main distinctive features of ELECTRE TRI when compared to other sorting methods. It also gives hints on the various methods that have been proposed to assess the parameters of ELECTRE TRI on the basis of assignment examples. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A number of recent papers have investigated the foundations of methods allowing to sort multi-attributed alternatives between several ordered categories. This paper has a similar objective. Our analysis uses a general conjoint measurement framework, encompassing most sorting models used in MDCM, that was proposed in the literature. Within this framework, we provide an axiomatic analysis of what we call noncompensatory sorting models, with or without veto effects. These noncompensatory sorting models contain the pessimistic version of ELECTRE TRI as a particular case. Our analysis can be seen as an attempt to give a firm axiomatic basis to ELECTRE TRI, while emphasizing its specific feature, i.e., the rather poor information that this model uses on each attribute. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={With the strengthening of corporate social responsibility, the need for an evaluation of the environmental performance exists and appears more and more meaningful for the companies. This research paper presents an experiment implemented within the Total Company about impact on water of the refineries. We first describe the context in which we built an evaluation tool which delivers a synthesis indicator. Then, we explain how this tool, based on Electre Tri, works. Afterwards, we present a “formalized” dialog process which allowed us to implement this tool. As a conclusion, this research paper aims to highlight what it could be considered as an added value of this evaluation tool. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This works aims at defining a multi criteria decision making method for the evaluation of sustainable urban projects. This integrated approach starts by investigating and describing the system of sustainable oriented goals of each decision makers working on an urban project. By modeling the final objectives in the form of tree structure, one obtains the reference frame which will make it possible to evaluate a sustainable performance for each decision maker. Then we will use a specific algebra to merge the tree structure of each actor of the decision process into a generic tree structure. Next we build criteria (indicators of sustainability) to represent each objective. Each criterion is provided with standard values to define various distances to the objective. Lastly, by incorporating the criteria on any level of the tree structure, and by using the Electre-Tri aggregation method, it is proposed an evaluation of each objective. A computer tool baptized Impact is embedding these various techniques. © 2007 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Usual approaches to identify costumer's perceptions about service are based on subjective evaluations under multiple criteria. Generally, an aggregation function based on weighted average method is used to solve this type of problem, in despite of the compensatory problems that it causes. Present work explores the application of an MCDM based method in order to solve this problem. An original approach to estimates p and q parameters in ELECTRE TRI is inserted on the model building, incorporating robustness to the proposal. Also, an original approach to incomparability's analyses is observed. An application of the proposal is experimented in a candy shop to evaluate consumer's satisfaction.},

abstract={This paper addresses the situation where a group wishes to cooperatively develop a common multicriteria evaluation model to sort actions (projects, candidates) into classes. It is based on an aggregation/disaggregation approach for the ELECTRE TRI method, implemented on the Decision Support System IRIS. We provide a methodology in which the group discusses how to sort some exemplary actions (possibly fictitious ones), instead of discussing what values the model parameters should take. This paper shows how IRIS may be used to help the group to iteratively reach an agreement on how to sort one or a few actions at a time, preserving the consistency of these sorting examples both at the individual level and at the collective level. The computation of information that may guide the discussion among the group members is also suggested. We provide an illustrative example and discuss some paths for future research motivated by this work. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Assessing the significance of environmental impacts is one of the most important and all together difficult processes of Environmental Impact Assessment. This is largely due to the multicriteria nature of the problem. To date, decision techniques used in the process suffer from two drawbacks, namely the problem of compensation and the problem of identification of the "exact boundary" between sub-ranges. This article discusses these issues and proposes a methodology for determining the significance of environmental impacts based on comparative and sensitivity analyses using the Electre TRI technique. An application of the methodology for the environmental assessment of a Power Plant project within the Valencian Region (Spain) is presented, and its performance evaluated. It is concluded that contrary to other techniques, Electre TRI automatically identifies those cases where allocation of significance categories is most difficult and, when combined with sensitivity analysis, offers greatest robustness in the face of variation in weights of the significance attributes. Likewise, this research demonstrates the efficacy of systematic comparison between Electre TRI and sum-based techniques, in the solution of assignment problems. The proposed methodology can therefore be regarded as a successful aid to the decision-maker, who will ultimately take the final decision. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={When considering Electre's valued outranking relations, aggregation/disaggregation methodologies have difficulties in taking discordance (veto) into account. We present a partial inference procedure to compute the value of the veto-related parameters that best restore a set of outranking statements (i.e., examples that an Electre model should restore) provided by a decision maker, given fixed values for the remaining parameters of the model. This paper complements previous work on the inference of other preference-related parameters (weights, cutting level, category limits, ...), advancing toward an integrated framework of inference problems in Electre III and Tri methods. We propose mathematical programs to infer veto-related parameters, first considering only one criterion, then all criteria simultaneously, using the original version of Electre outranking relation and two variants. This paper shows that these inference procedures lead to linear programming, 0-1 linear programming, or separable programming problems, depending on the case. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The civil construction sector has an important place in the country's economic and social development, producing goods of attendance related to the human necessities or to the productive capacity. The management material process has assumed great relevance due to its strategic role on reducing costs and pushing up the construction companies' technological and organizational innovation. The basic question to be considered is the way that material classification can be done using multiple criteria; hence this procedure is not being use in the construction site and may lead into problems such as lack of materials and production interruption. Thus, this work presents a case study, aiming to present a structuralized multicriteria model to the decision process in the civil construction materials management. The model aim to categorize the material in three classes.},

abstract={This paper presents a new multicriteria sorting procedure in financial classification problems, based on the methodological framework of PROMETHEE method. The proposed procedure, called as PROMSORT, is applied to the business failure risk problem and compared to PROMETHEE TRI and ELECTRE TRI. The proposed methodology also identifies the differences in performances across risk groups, and assists in monitoring the firms' financial performances. The results showed that the proposed procedure can be considered as an effective alternative to existing methods in financial classification problems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={In ELECTRE methods, the construction of an outranking relation amounts at validating or invalidating, for any pair of alternatives (a,b), the assertion "a is at least as good as b". This comparison is grounded on the evaluation vectors of both alternatives, and on additional information concerning the decision maker's preferences, accounting for two conditions: concordance and non-discordance. In decision processes using these methods, the analyst should interact with the decision maker in order to elicit values for preferential parameters. This can be done either directly or through a disaggregation procedure that infers the parameters values from holistic judgements provided by the decision maker. Inference is usually performed through an optimization program that accounts for the aggregation model and minimizes an "error function". Although disaggregation approaches have been largely used in additive models, only few advances have been made towards a disaggregation approach for outranking methods. Indeed, outranking methods may lead to computationally difficult inference problems. In this paper we are concerned with a slight adaptation of the valued outranking relation used in the ELECTRE III and ELECTRE TRI. Such modification is shown to preserve the original discordance concept. We show that the modified outranking relation makes it easier to solve inference programs. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Several interactive methods exist to identify nondominated solutions in a Multiple Objective Mixed Integer Linear Program. But what if the Decision Maker is also interested in sorting those solutions (assigning them to pre-established ordinal categories)? We propose an interactive "branch-and-bound like" technique to progressively build the nondominated set, combined with ELECTRE TRI method (Pessimistic procedure) to sort identified nondominated solutions. A disaggregation approach is considered in order to avoid direct definition of all ELECTRE TRI preference parameters. Weight-importance coefficients are inferred and category reference profiles are determined based on assignment examples provided by the Decision Maker. A computation tool was developed with a twofold purpose: support the Decision Maker involved in a decision process and provide a test bed for research purposes. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={We consider a framework where decision makers (DMs) interactively define a multicriteria evaluation model by providing imprecise information (i.e., a linear system of constraints to the model's parameters) and by analyzing the consequences of the information provided. DMs may introduce new constraints explicitly or implicitly (results that the model should yield). If a new constraint is incompatible with the previous ones, then the system becomes inconsistent and the DMs must choose between removing the new constraint or removing some of the older ones. We address the problem of identifying subsets of constraints which, when removed, lead to a consistent system. Identifying such subsets would indicate the reason for the inconsistent information given by DMs. There may exist several possibilities for the DMs to resolve the inconsistency. We present two algorithms to identify such possibilities, one using {0,1} mixed integer linear programming and the other one using linear programming. Both approaches are based on the knowledge that the system was consistent prior to introducing the last constraint. The output of these algorithms helps the DM to identify the conflicting pieces of information in a set of statements he/she asserted. The relevance of these algorithms for MCDA is illustrated by an application to an aggregation/disaggregation procedure for the Electre Tri method. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The introduction of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 represents a very important step in the effort for the limitation of the emissions of greenhouse gases. The energy sector, being responsible for the large majority of emissions, represents the most crucial field for undertaking mitigation actions. A large number of potential emission reduction measures exist in this sector, characterised by different cost, applicability difficulties, environmental and social impacts. These criteria define the degree of acceptance of the various actors involved in the decision-making process. In this paper, the possibilities offered by a multicriteria method - namely ELECTRE Tri - are investigated through its application in the case study of Greece, in order to define national priorities for a National Action Plan for GHG mitigation in the energy sector and to formulate a relevant time-schedule for actions' implementation. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={The European policy target of substantially increasing the share of renewable energy in electricity generation, in combination with national subsidization support schemes, has strongly motivated private investors towards this business sector. In Greece, this interest is particularly apparent in the case of wind energy exploitation, due to a favourable legislative framework and the important wind potential available in several Greek regions. In such endowed regions, a very high number of applications were submitted to the competent authority, most of which compete for the same most attractive (windy) sites. The selection among these applications is a multicriteria problem that has been solved with the support of a Decision-Aid tool combining the multicriteria classification method ELECTRE-TRI with Integer Linear Programming. The developed approach takes into account both, the performances of the applications to the evaluation criteria, as well as a number of technical and policy constraints.},

abstract={This paper presents Interactive Robustness analysis and parameters’ Inference for multicriteria Sorting problems (IRIS), a Decision Support System (DSS) designed to sort actions (projects, candidates, alternatives, clients, etc.) described by their performances on multiple criteria into an ordered set of categories defined a priori. It is based on the ELECTRE TRI sorting method, but does not require the decision maker (DM) to indicate precise values for all of the method’s parameters. More realistically, the software expects the DM to indicate some constraints that these parameters should respect, including sorting examples that the program should reproduce. If the constraints indicated by the DM do not contradict each other (i.e. form a consistent system), then IRIS infers a combination of parameter values that reproduces all the sorting examples, indicating also the range of possible assignments of actions to categories that would be possible without violating any of the stated constraints. If the constraints are contradictory (i.e. form an inconsistent system), then IRIS suggests a combination of parameter values that minimizes an error function and identifies alternative ways to restore the system’s consistency by removing some constraints. © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={ELECTRE TRI is a well-known method to assign a set of alternatives to a set of predefined categories, considering multiple criteria. Using this method requires setting many parameters, which is often a difficult task. We consider the case where the decision makers (DMs) in the decision process are unsure of which values should each parameter take, which may result from uncertain, imprecise or inaccurately determined information, as well as from lack of consensus among them. This paper discusses the synergy between two approaches developed independently to deal with this difficulty. The first approach infers the value of parameters from assignment examples provided by the DMs, as an elicitation aid. Each assignment example originates mathematical constraints that the parameter values should satisfy. The second approach considers a set of constraints on the parameter values reflecting the imprecise information that the DMs are able to provide. Then, it computes the best and worst categories for each alternative compatible with constraints, in order to present robust conclusions. Both approaches avoid asking for precise values for the parameters. Rather, they proceed to solve the problem in a way that requires from the DMs much less effort. By integrating these two approaches, this paper proposes a new interactive approach, where the insight obtained during robustness analyses guides the DMs during the elicitation phase. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Over the past two decades, the quantitative analysis of financial and banking decisions has gained significant interest among researchers and practitioners. A significant part of the research conducted in this field focused on the development of analytical models that can be used in evaluating the alternative ways of action in financial and banking problems. Typically, this evaluation involves the choice of the best alternative, the ranking of the alternatives from the best to the worst ones, or their classification into predefined homogenous classes. This paper is focused on the classification approach illustrating the use of multi–criteria decision aid (MCDA) classification methods in making financial and banking decisions. Three MCDA approaches (the UTADIS method, the ELECTRE TRI method, and the rough set approach) are applied in financial and banking problems, such as business failure prediction, credit–risk assessment, and portfolio selection and management. A comparison is also performed with linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, and logit analysis. International Federation of Operational Research Societies 2002.},

abstract={Given a finite set of alternatives A, the sorting (or assignment) problem consists in the assignment of each alternative to one of the pre-defined categories. In this paper, we are interested in multiple criteria sorting problems and, more precisely, in the existing method ELECTRE TRI. This method requires the elicitation of preferential parameters (weights, thresholds, category limits, ...) in order to construct a preference model which the decision maker (DM) accepts as a working hypothesis in the decision aid study. A direct elicitation of these parameters requiring a high cognitive effort from the DM, proposed an interactive aggregation-disaggregation approach that infers ELECTRE TRI parameters indirectly from holistic information, i.e., assignment examples. In this approach, the determination of ELECTRE TRI parameters that best restore the assignment examples is formulated through a nonlinear optimization program. In this paper, we consider the subproblem of the determination of the weights only (the thresholds and category limits being fixed). This subproblem leads to solve a linear program (rather than nonlinear in the global inference model). Numerical experiments were conducted so as to check the behaviour of this disaggregation tool. Results showed that this tool is able to infer weights that restores in a stable way the assignment examples and that it is able to identify `inconsistencies' in the assignment examples.},

abstract={Land-use planners often make complex decisions within a short period of time when they must take into account sustainable development and economic competitiveness. A set of land-use suitability maps would be very useful in this respect. Ideally, these maps should incorporate complex criteria integrating several stakeholders' points of view. To illustrate the feasibility of this approach, a land suitability map for housing was realised for a small region of Switzerland. Geographical Information System technology was used to assess the criteria requested to define the suitability of land for housing. An example dealing with the evaluation of noise levels illustrates the initial steps of this procedure. Because the required criteria are heterogeneous and measured on various scales, an out-ranking multicriteria analysis method called ELECTRE-TRI was used. However, using it to assess the suitability of any point in a territory was impractical due to computational limitations. Therefore, a mathematical function to evaluate closeness relationships and classify the study area into homogeneous zones was used. This function is compatible with the outranking function of ELECTRE-TRI used to assess the suitability index. The resulting maps lend efficient support to negotiation and are very useful in dealing with inherent conflicts in land-use planning.},

abstract={In this paper is described the implementation of a multi-criteria analysis in order to answer a question of researchers of the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) who assess the impact of agricultural practices on the environmental components. They were particularly interested in differentiating cropping systems (CSs) as a function of their impact on groundwater quality. In order to give effect to this differentiation, members of the Laboratoire d'Analyse et de Modelisation de Systemes pour l'Aide a la Decision (LAMSADE) proposed a way of sorting CSs using the ELECTRE TRI method. Four categories of impact were defined and three families of criteria were built up. The main debate was about the nature of criteria: if basic data are used, the number of the criteria is high; if aggregated data are used, exchanges of information are tedious. In spite of difficulties, the study has been of important value for the agronomic researchers. Firstly, it helps them to work with decision-makers, such as the Water Agency: it allows farmers to be given concrete examples of CSs which preserve groundwater quality. Secondly, the multi-criteria methodology used seems to fit their researches: they are indeed now using the same approach to differentiate CSs on the basis of their impact on wild fauna or landscape quality.},

abstract={Multiple Criteria Sorting Problem consists in assigning a set of alternatives A = {a1, a2, ..., a(l)} evaluated on n criteria g1, g2, ..., g(n) to one of the categories which are pre-defined by some norms corresponding to vectors of scores on particular criteria, called profiles, either separating the categories or playing the role of central reference objects in the categories. The assignment of an alternative a(k) to a specific category results from a comparison of its evaluation on all criteria with the profiles defining the categories. This paper presents a new implementation of an existing method called ELECTRE TRI. It integrates specific functionalities supporting the decision maker (DM) in the preference elicitation process. These functionalities grouped in ELECTRE TRI Assistant aim at reducing the cognitive effort required from the DM in the phase of calibration of the preference model. The main characteristic feature of ELECTRE TRI Assistant is the inference of the ELECTRE TRI preferential parameters from assignment examples supplied by the DM. The software is presented through an illustrative example. Scope and purpose Decision makers (DMs) often face decision situations in which different conflicting viewpoints (goals or criteria) are to be considered. The field of multiple criteria decision aid (MCDA) offers the DMs a selection of methods and operational tools that explicitly account for the diversity of the viewpoints considered. Each method constructs first a model of DM's preferences and then exploits this model in order to workout a recommendation. A large class of methods proposed in the literature use an outranking relation as a preference model (whose semantic is 'at least as good as'). In order to implement these methods in real-world applications, the values of preference parameters, like importance coefficients and discrimination thresholds, are to be given by the DM. As this is usually a difficult task, we propose to infer values of these parameters from examples of decisions supplied by the DM. Such an approach to preference modeling is called aggregation/disaggregation approach. The paper describes an implementation of an outranking method integrating this kind of preference elicitation support. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

abstract={ELECTRE TRI is a well-known method to assign actions to predefined ordered categories, considering multiple criteria. Using this method requires setting many parameters, which is often a difficult task. We consider the case where a group of Decision Makers (DMs) is unsure of which values each parameter should take, which may result from insufficient, imprecise or contradictory information, as well as from lack of consensus among the group members.

abstract={The present article demonstrates the implementation of Multicriterion Decision Making “MCDM” analysis for a case study of Flumen Monegros irrigation area in the Huesca province of Spain. The criteria used to rank alternatives consist of “1” economic factors including initial cost of irrigation system, maintenance cost, profitability of crops, extent of European subsidies; “2” environmental factors which comprise water volume, water quality after irrigation, efficiency of the use of water, resistance to floods or droughts; “3” Social factors including employment of rural labour, area non-cultivated. Alternative policies are formulated by mixing factors such as irrigation system, water pricing, water allocation, crop distribution, fertiliser use, subsidies received. Multicriterion Sorting Technique “MCST” ELECTRE-TRI is employed to reduce the large size payoff matrix to predefined categories for further usage of MCDM techniques. Five MCDM techniques, namely, PROMETHEE-2, EXPROM-2, ELECTRE-3, ELECTRE-4, and Compromise Programming “CP” are employed to rank the alternatives. Spearman rank correlation coefficient is employed to assess the correlation coefficient between the ranking patterns obtained by the above MCDM techniques. Additive ranking principle is used for group decision making analysis. Results indicate that five MCDM techniques choose the same alternative strategy as the preferred one.},

abstract={The ELECTRE family of decision aid methods is a well-known approach to help decision makers (DMs) advance in a decision process. Among the most recent methods in the family, ELECTRE IS, III, and TRI compute fuzzy indices for the credibility of a given action outranking some other. We consider the case when the DMs are unsure which values each parameter should take, which may result from insufficient, imprecise or contradictory information, as well as from different preferences among a group of DMs. In the framework of a robustness analysis approach, where DMs provide only partial information on the parameter values (through constraints on acceptable combinations), we study how to find whether an outranking among two actions in an ELECTRE method is robust. In this context, we study the resulting nonlinear problems of optimizing a credibility index (under the type of constraints that we consider to appear in practice) and present some examples. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Given a finite set of alternatives, the sorting problem consists in the assignment of each alternative to one of the pre-defined categories. In this paper, we are interested in multiple criteria sorting problems and, more precisely, in the existing method ELECTRE TRI. This method requires the elicitation of parameters (weights, thresholds, category limits,...) in order to construct the Decision Maker's (DM) preference model. A direct elicitation of these parameters being rather difficult, we proceed to solve this problem in a way that requires from the DM much less cognitive effort. We elicit these parameters indirectly using holistic information given by the DM through assignment examples. We propose an interactive approach that infers the parameters of an ELECTRE TRI model from assignment examples. The determination of an ELECTRE TRI model that best restitutes the assignment examples is formulated through an optimization problem. The interactive aspect of this approach lies in the possibility given to the DM to revise his/her assignment examples and/or to give additional information before the optimization phase restarts.},
