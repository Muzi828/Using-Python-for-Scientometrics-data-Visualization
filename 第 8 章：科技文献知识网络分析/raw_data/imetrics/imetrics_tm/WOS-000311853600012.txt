The overall goal of this study is to explain how information literacy instruction (ILI) influences the adoption of online library resources (OLR) by business students. A theoretical model was developed that integrates research on ILI outcomes and technology adoption. To test this model, a web-based survey, which included both closed and open-ended questions, was administered to 337 business students. Findings indicate that the ILI received by students is beneficial in the initial or early stages of OLR use; however, students quickly reach a saturation point where more instruction contributes little, if anything, to the final outcome, such as reduced OLR anxiety and increased OLR self-efficacy. Rather, it is the independent, continuous use of OLR after receiving initial, formal ILI that creates continued positive effects. Importantly, OLR self-efficacy and anxiety were found to be important antecedents to OLR adoption. OLR anxiety also partially mediates the relationship between self-efficacy and perceived ease of use. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.
