It is shown that the generalized Pareto distribution gives a good fit to citable documents, citations above a threshold and also for the h-index of countries. The h-index has a finite second moment, while the citable documents and citations are extremely heavy tailed with the estimated index of citations less than one. The relationship derived between the h-index, citation and number of publications is also investigated and the model proposed by Glanzel confirmed empirically.
