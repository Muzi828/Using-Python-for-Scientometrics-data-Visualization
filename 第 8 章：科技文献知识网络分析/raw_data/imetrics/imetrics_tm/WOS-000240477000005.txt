Are prior self-citations an effective input in increasing a subsequent article's citation count? Examination of 418 articles in eight economics journals found that, after controlling for article length, journal and author quality, lead article position, and coauthorship, an author's prior stock of self-citations is not statistically related to a subsequent article's total citation count or the quality of the journals in which those citations appear. Self-citations that appear in prestigious high-impact economics journals have a statistically positive, but numerically small, effect on a subsequent article's total citation count and on the quality of the citing journal. The productive effect of a prior self-citation is inversely related to its age. Prior self-citations of the second author listed in a collaborative article have no significant effect on a subsequent article's total citation count or the quality of the economics journals in which those citations appear.
