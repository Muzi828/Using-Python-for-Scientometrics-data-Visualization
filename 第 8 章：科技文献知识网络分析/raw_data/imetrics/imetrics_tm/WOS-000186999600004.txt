The purpose of this study is to map semiconductor literature by author co-citation analysis in order to highlight major subject specializations in semiconductors and identify authors and their relationships within these specialties and within the field. Forty-six of the most productive authors were included in the sample list. Author samples were gathered from the INSPEC database from 1978 to 1997. The relatively low author co-citation frequencies indicate that there is a low connection among authors who publish in semiconductor journals and big differences among authors' research areas. Six sets of authors with co-citation greater than 100 times are M. Cardona and G. Lucovsky; T. Ito and K. Kobayashi; M. Cardona and G. Abstreiter; A. Y. Cho and H. Morkoc; C. R. Abernathy and W. S. Hobson; H. Morkoc and I. Akasaki. The Pearson correlation coefficient of author co-citation varies widely, i.e., from -0.17 to 0.92. This shows that some authors with high positive correlations are related in certain ways and co-cited, while other authors with high negative correlations may be rarely or never related and co-cited. Cluster analysis and multi-dimensional scaling are employed to create two-dimensional maps of author relationships in the cross-citation networks. It is found that the authors fall fairly clearly into three clusters. The first cluster covers authors in physics and its applications. The authors in the second group are experts in electrical and electronic engineering. The third group includes specialists in materials science. Because of its interdisciplinary nature and diverse subjects, semiconductor literature lacks a strong group of core authors. The field consists of several specialties around a weak center.
