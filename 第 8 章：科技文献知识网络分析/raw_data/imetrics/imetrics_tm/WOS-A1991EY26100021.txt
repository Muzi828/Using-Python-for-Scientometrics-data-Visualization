The impact of a 17 year period of funding in schistosomiasis research on publication outcome was examined.  Two productivity and three quality indicators were used to compare the output from the entire population of schistosomiasis in this period with those associated with 351 funded researchers.  A substantially higher productivity and citation impact were found.  This consistency of direction points to the positive effect of a period of sustained funding commitment.
