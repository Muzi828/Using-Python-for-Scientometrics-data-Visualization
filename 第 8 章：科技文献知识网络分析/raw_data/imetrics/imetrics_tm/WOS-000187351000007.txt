MEDLINE(R) is a collection of more than 12 million references and abstracts covering recent life science literature. With its continued growth and cutting-edge terminology, spell-checking with a traditional lexicon based approach requires significant additional manual follow-up. In this work, an internal corpus based context quality rating a, frequency, and simple misspelling transformations are used to rank words from most likely to be misspellings to least likely. Eleven-point average precisions of 0.891 have been achieved within a class of 42,340 all alphabetic words having an a score less than 10. Our models predict that 16,274 or 38% of these words are misspellings. Based on test data, this result has a recall of 79% and a precision of 86%. In other words, spell checking can be done by statistics instead of with a dictionary. As an application we examine the time history of low a words in MEDLINE(R) titles and abstracts.
