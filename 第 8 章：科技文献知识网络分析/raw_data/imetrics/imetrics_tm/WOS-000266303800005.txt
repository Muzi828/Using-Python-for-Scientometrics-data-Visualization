In this article, bibliometric indicators with publications and citations are used for a direct research-performance comparison among different or interdisciplinary categories, the work of individual scientists, and their research teams and institutions. For example, basic research performances of some projects at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) were assessed using bibliographic factors with IPQ-Normalized impact factor to compare with an international level and other research groups in different or interdisciplinary fields. Some research teams at KIST showed higher quality publications in terms of the international measures.
