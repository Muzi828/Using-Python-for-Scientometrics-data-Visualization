This paper gives an outline of a new bibliometric database based upon all articles published by authors from the Netherlands, and processed during the time period 1980-1993 by the institute for Scientific Information (ISI) for the Science Citation index (SCI), Social Science Citation index (SSCI) and Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI). The paper describes various types of information added to the database: data on articles citing the Dutch publications; detailed citation data on ISI journals and subfields; and a classification system of publishing main organizations, appearing in the addresses. Moreover, an overview is given of the types of bibliometric indicators that were constructed. Their relationship to indicators developed by other researchers in the field is discussed. Finally, two applications are given in order to illustrate the potentials of the database and of the bibliometric indicators derived from it. The first represents a synthesis of 'classical' macro indicator studies at the one hand, and bibliometric analyses of research groups or institutes at the other. The second application gives for the first time a detailed analysis of a country's publication output per institutional sector.
