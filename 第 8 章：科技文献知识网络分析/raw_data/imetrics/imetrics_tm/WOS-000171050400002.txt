This study explored higher-order thinking processes in undergraduates using a virtual library. Ten undergraduates pursuing topics pertaining to their academic work were interviewed and observed as they used GALILEO (GeorgiA Library LEarning Online, a virtual library containing many scholarly databases). Specifically, the study focused on relevance judging, evaluation (critical thinking), and decision making. We found a high degree of intermingling between relevance judging and evaluation, along with a number of strategies participants used to assist them in both thinking processes. Also, participants made decisions through one of three avenues in each of their appraisals of online resources.
