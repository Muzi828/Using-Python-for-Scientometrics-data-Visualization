A method of information-based evaluation of the quality of doctoral theses has been worked out. It is based on a multidimensional classification system which includes: a list of attributes to characterize the given theses and their authors; singling out the most significant attributes; calculating a complex criterion showing the quality of a thesis on the basis of a series of significant attributes; ranging the theses according to this criterion. This method was used to evaluate 36 doctoral theses in chemistry according to 41 attributes considered. Four main attributes were singled out. Based on them a complex quality criterion which we termed the originality index was calculated. The values of the originality index of these theses differed by an order of magnitude. Two attributes affecting the index of originality were singled out: the place where the thesis was prepared, and the fact whether the author had any papers published in non-Academy journals (journals not published by the USSR Academy of Sciences).
