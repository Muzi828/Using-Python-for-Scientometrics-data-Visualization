In 1988 Le Pair postulated the existence of a citation gap for technological research. Several cases were studied, which confirmed his hypothesis. In the same period the use of bibliometric indicators for policy purposes increased. Here we saw the citation gap causing a disadvantage for application-oriented research groups. This is not merely an injustice, it also leads to suboptimum use of available funds, to the detriment of science as a whole. In addition, it may, in the long term, undermine the reputation of scientometrics as a science ih its own right.
