Given extensive research collaboration in modem science, both at the national and international level, one might wonder whether the network of researchers within each discipline is now sufficiently meshed that a large proportion of contributors to peer-reviewed journals in a given field could either share joint publications or, more realistically, be connected through chains of co-authorships. Such is not the case yet in the fields of probability and statistics, however, as shown here using a large data base covering 9 reknown journals from each of these two areas over the period 1986-1995.
