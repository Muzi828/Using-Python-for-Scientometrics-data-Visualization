This article presents a case study of the information-seeking behavior of 7-year-old children in a semistructured situation in their school library media center. The study focuses on how young children who are in the process of learning to read cope with searching for information in a largely textual corpus, and how they make up for their deficit in textual experience. Children's search strategies are examined and discussed in the context of computer versus shelf searching, textual versus visual searching, and in comparison with adult search dimensions previously established.
