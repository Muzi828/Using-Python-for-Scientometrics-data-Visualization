The paper provides data from a first exploration of the literature of Vision Science as seen bibliometrically through the ISI's three citation indexes, SCI, SSCI, & AHCI. The main focus of analysis is on the major fields of Ophthalmology and Optics (SC=OPTICS and SC=OPHTHALMOLOGY) with a focus on Australia's contribution to those literatures. Australia's publication frequency vis-a-vis the world, its collaboration with authors from other nations, and the journals in which Australians most frequently publish are shown. Comparison of productivity is made for countries of similar scientific stature, or of language and Commonwealth status.
