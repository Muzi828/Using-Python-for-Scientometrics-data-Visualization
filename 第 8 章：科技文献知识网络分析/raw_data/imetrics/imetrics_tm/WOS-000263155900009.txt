A socio-economic networking (SEN) of the public funded basic research (PFBR) in the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) was studied by the bibliometric method combined with the international nuclear database INIS. As PFBR, Material Science (MS) research of JAERI is chosen. The appropriateness of the present bibliometric method is discussed. The authors believe that this method is applicable to studying the socio-economic effect on PFBR. The shortcoming of it is, however, the use of the inevitable usage of biased EBRF (ranked keywords), accompanied with the feeling of unfairness. The authors confirm that the S-matrix has a potential capability to show the quantitative magnitude of co-operation among research institutions avoiding significant bias.
