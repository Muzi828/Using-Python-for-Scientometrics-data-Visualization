The number of chemical substances is considered as a cumulative measure of the cognitive growth of preparative chemistry. During the past 200 years there is approximately exponential growth without saturation. Separate analysis of organic and inorganic chemistry suggests at least a two-phase model either. Detailed discussion of the results (considering also the growth of chemists, chemical papers, patents, and chemical elements) reveals that an external (socio-economical) explanation is insufficient. Instead, an internal (methodological) approach is suggested to explain the exponential growth as well as balancing phenomena in war and post-war times.
