We shall generalize the concept of our previous paper (SHIRABE & TOMIZAWA, 2002), which proposed an index for international scientific co-authorship. Based on a simple model of domestic and international co-authorships, we focused on likelihood of overseas access to co-authorships in the paper. Here, in consideration of bidirectionality of international co-authorship, we shall extend our previous index to two symmetrical indices. The indices can draw a reasonably clear picture of international co-authorship, with regard to difference in patterns of international co-authorship among countries.
