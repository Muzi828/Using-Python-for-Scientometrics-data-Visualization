An indicator called the performance index (p-index) which can effectively combine size and quality of scientific papers, mocking what the h-index could do, emerges from an energy like term E = iC, where i is a measure of quality, expressed as the ratio of citations C to papers published P. In this paper, we demonstrate how this energy paradigm can be used for bibliometric research assessment. The energy assessment technique is demonstrated by applying it to the research assessment of all the countries listed in Essential Science Indicators. Partitioning is easily done by using contour lines on the two-dimensional iCE (impact-Citations-Energy) map.
