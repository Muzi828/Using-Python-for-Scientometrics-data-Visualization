This article presents results from 21 semi-structured interviews with museum information professionals (MIPs) who were asked about their experiences working with information resources, tools, and technologies. Interviews were analyzed to determine (a) the challenges MIPs face as they adapt to changing technical capabilities and strive to meet the changing needs and expectations of museum users and (b) the coping mechanisms MIPs employ on the job that enable them to deal effectively with those challenges. This article explores the results of this analysis, exploring how MIPs cope with the changing nature of information work in museums by relying on thirteen different strategies including (a) assessing new technologies in relation to the museum's core mission, (b) helping museum professionals embrace new ideas about information access and provision, and (c) promoting internal practices that encourage the sharing of information and the integration of information science into museum work. This article also discusses the implications of these challenges and strategies for current and future MIPs, and assesses their impact on changing perceptions, roles, and research for information professionals in museums as they work to meet the information needs of all museum users.
