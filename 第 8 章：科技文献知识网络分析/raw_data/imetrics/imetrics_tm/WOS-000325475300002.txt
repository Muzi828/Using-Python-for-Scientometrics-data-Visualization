Quantifying the scientific performance of investigators has become an integral part of decision-making in research policy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if there is a correlation between journal impact factor (IF) and researchers' influence among a selected group of Brazilian investigators in the fields of clinical nephrology and neurosciences. This study was based on 94 senior investigators (36 in clinical nephrology and 58 in clinical neurosciences) receiving productivity scholarships from the Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) according to a list provided by the agency in February 2009. Scientific performance indicators included in the analysis were: number of papers indexed by the Web of Science and Scopus databases, number of citations, h- and m-index. IFs were analyzed as (1) cumulative IF (Sigma IF), (2) IF adjusted by time (IF/t), and (3) average IF. There was a moderate positive correlation only between aIF and two indicators: total number of citations (P < 0.001) and h-index (P < 0.001). There was also a positive correlation between IF/t and m-index (P < 0.001). There was an agreement in these correlations between both groups (clinical nephrology and neurosciences). No significant correlation between the average IF and any of the scientific indicators was detected. A cut-off of 10.53 for IF/t showed the best performance in predicting researchers with m-index equal to or greater than 1. According to our findings, other qualitative and quantitative instruments rather than IF are clearly needed for identifying researchers with outstanding scientific output.
