Results are presented of a scientometric analysis focusing on peripheral dynamics in a scientific field. We evaluate different techniques on their appropriateness for detecting relations between aspects that seem to be not of central interest but are important in innovative research. We do so in order to quantify the role that adverse drug reactions can play as trigger points in innovative drug research.
