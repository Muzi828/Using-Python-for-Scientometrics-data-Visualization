In this paper we have looked at a new measure of connectedness between research areas, namely, the migration of authors between subfields as seen from their contributions to different areas. Migration may be considered as an embodied knowledge flow that bridges some part of the cognitive gap between fields. Our hypothesis is that the rate of author migration will reflect cognitive similarity or affinity between disciplines. This is graphically shown to be reasonable, but only above certain levels of migration for our data from mathematical reviews spanning 17 years (1959-1975). The inter-related structure of Mathematics is then mapped using migration data in the appropriate range. We find the resulting map to be a good reflection of the disciplinary variation in the field of Mathematics.
