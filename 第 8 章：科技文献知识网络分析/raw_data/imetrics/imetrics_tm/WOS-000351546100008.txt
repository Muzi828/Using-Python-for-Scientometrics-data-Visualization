This study uses several quantitative techniques to enable a multidimensional analysis of 47 key business journals by analyzing the scientific communication patterns and structural influences of these journals. Apart from using clustering techniques to establish research clusters in the Business domain, we apply a refined PageRank method by differentiating between the citation types to enable a cross-sectional evaluation of the selected journals. The results indicate that the five most influential journals are from Finance and Economics. The selected Finance journals are knowledge hubs and the selected Economics journals are knowledge sources when ISI's entire journal database is considered. However, within the Business domain, the selected Finance journals appear to be high impact knowledge hubs while the selected Economics journals appear to be high impact journals despite weak citation activity. All in all, such analyses are beneficial to scholars when selecting publication outlets to showcase their research, and to agencies such Financial Times and Bloomberg when selecting their journals basket for their annual journal evaluation exercises.
