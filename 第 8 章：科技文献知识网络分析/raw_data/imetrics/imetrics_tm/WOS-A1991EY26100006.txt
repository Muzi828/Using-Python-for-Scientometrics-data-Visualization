Using the field of acid rain research as a case study, it was found that scientists who contribute to the popular literature are more likely than others to be called on to give Congressional testimony (and vice versa) and that the work of these same scientists is well recognized by their peers as judged by rates of citation. Indeed, scientists who contribute to the popular literature are more highly cited than those who do not whether or not they are called upon for expert testimony. Since those who give testimony are more highly cited than those who do not, some evidence also exists that scientists called before Congressional hearings are among those most influential in the science community.
