This paper analyses some of the methodologies and R&D and innovation indicators used to measure Regional Innovative Capacity in Spain for the period 1996-2000. The results suggest that the approaches examined are not sufficiently rigorous; they vary depending on the methodology and indicators employed.
Therefore, we would suggest that the right balance between quantitative and qualitative approaches could produce a better evaluation of innovation system performance which would be more useful to policy makers and other stakeholders.
