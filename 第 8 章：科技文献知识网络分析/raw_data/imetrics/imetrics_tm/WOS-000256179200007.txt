The order effect of relevance judgment refers to the different relevance perceptions of a document when it appears in different positions in a list. Although the order effect of relevance judgment has significant theoretical and practical implications, the extant literature is inconclusive regarding its existence and forming mechanisms. This study proposes a set of order effect forming mechanisms, including the learning effect, the subneed scheduling effect, and the cursoriness effect based on the conceptualization of dynamic relevance and the psychology of cognitive elaboration. Our empirical study indicates that in an interactive information retrieval setting, when a document list is reasonably long, order effects demonstrate a curvilinear pattern that conforms to the combined effect of the three mechanisms. Moreover, the curvilinear pattern of order effect could differ for documents of different relevance levels.
