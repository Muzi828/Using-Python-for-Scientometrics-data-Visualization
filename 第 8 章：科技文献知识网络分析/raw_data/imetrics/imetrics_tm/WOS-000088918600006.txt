This paper analyses communications between statistical methodology and applied statistics in terms of the similarity and dissimilarity in their authorship and citation patterns, and further the communication distance between them in terms of mutual citation and the time lag therein. Hypotheses are presented on their difference and distance and are verified for data from the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, the oldest statistical society in the world. The data analysis reveals that they are indeed different and distant each other to a certain extent but less distinctly than initially conjectured in the hypotheses.
