This paper sets out to explore the patterns of technological change and knowledge spillover in the field of flat panel display (FPD) technology, along with the catching-up behavior of latecomers, through the analysis of US patents and patent citations between 1976 and 2005. Our results show that: (i) the catching-up by FPD technology latecomers began at the transition stage (1987-1996) when the dominant design became established in areas with high 'revealed technology advantage' (RTA); (ii) there is no apparent localization of knowledge spillover amongst FPD technology latecomers; instead, higher citation frequencies of forerunners' patents were found in latecomers' FPD patents during the transition (1987-1996) and post-dominant design (1997-2005) stages and; and (iii) a few extraordinary peaks were found in the citation frequency of forerunners' patents at long citation lags in latecomers' FPD patents, particularly during the transition stage (1987-1996), indicative of the knowledge threshold which latecomers need to cross in order to catch up with forerunners.
