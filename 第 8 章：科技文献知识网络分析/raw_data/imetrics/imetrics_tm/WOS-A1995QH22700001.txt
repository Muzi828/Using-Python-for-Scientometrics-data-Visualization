In order to explore the possibility that the assignment of University chairs could be automated, we have carried out a comparative analysis of the relative scientific and technological level of candidates competing nationally for given chairs of first (full professor) and second (associate professor) level, using indicators such as the number of publications and citations in international journals, the number of patents and inventions and few others. This study, contrary to some gloomy opinions, has suggested that at least for what concerns hard science, performances can be measured impartially at least to some extent. Bibliometric indicators, when properly weighted., appear to be effective parameters to monitor degree of excellence in scholastic rating and to establish reliable objective standards. Their utilization, however, to automate the assignment of university chairs appears still questionable and should be limited to the needed provision of computer-assisted selection criteria and reference databank.
