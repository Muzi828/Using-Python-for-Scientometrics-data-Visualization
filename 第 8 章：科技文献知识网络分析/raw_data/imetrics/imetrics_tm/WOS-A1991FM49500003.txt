Evidence is examined for the repeated claim that published papers with more than one author are, on average, of higher quality than those with a single author.  Among published studies it is shown that no clear conclusion can be drawn, though evidence supporting the claim is stronger in astronomy and physics than among the social sciences.  An empirical study of 656 papers in four Australian science journals produced negative results.  Possible reasons for the differing results, and difficulties in researching the field, are highlighted.
