The paper focusses on possible mathematical theories of citation and on the intrinsic problems related to it. It sheds light on aspects of mathematical complexity as e.g. encountered in fractal theory and Mandelbrot's law. There is also a discussion on dynamical aspects of citation theory as reflected in evolutions of journal rankings, centres of gravity or of the set of source journals. Some comments are given in this connection on growth and obsolescence.
