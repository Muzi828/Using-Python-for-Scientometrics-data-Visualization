A network approach was used to determine the overall supportive communication patterns constructed within the PTT psychosis support group in Taiwan, the largest bulletin board system in the Chinese-speaking world. The full sequences of supportive interactions were observed over a 21-year period from February 2004 to July 2006. The resits indicated that the most exchanged support types were information and network links. All types of supportive communication networks were relatively sparse, yet small groups of cliques with different provision of support types formed within the psychosis group. Most of the online supportive interactions exchanged at dyadic and triadic levels. The overall supportive network was highly centralized. The overall findings with implications for future studies were discussed.
