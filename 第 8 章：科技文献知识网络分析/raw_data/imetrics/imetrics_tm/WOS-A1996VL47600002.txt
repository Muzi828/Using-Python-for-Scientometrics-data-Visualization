In the first part, the present paper presents a quantitative analysis of physics publications in the domain of experimental particle physics, before the Second World War in the field of cosmic rays physics and for the modem times in the field of accelerator and collision rings experiments. In the second part, a more general study is made on publications in the various fields of physics separating contributions from experiment, theory and techniques. Three aspects of physics are enlightened: physics of exploration, physics of applications, and forefront physics.
