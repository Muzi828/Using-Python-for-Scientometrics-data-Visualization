This study uses author co-citation analysis to trace prospectively the development of the cognitive neuroscience of attention between 1980 and 2005 from its precursor disciplines: cognitive psychology, single cell neurophysiology, neuropsychology, and evoked potential research. The author set consists of 28 authors highly active in attentional research in the mid-1980s. PFNETS are used to present the co-citation networks. Authors are clustered via the single-link clustering intrinsic to the PFNET algorithm. By 1990 a distinct cognitive neuroscience specialty cluster emerges, dominated by authors engaged in brain imaging research.
