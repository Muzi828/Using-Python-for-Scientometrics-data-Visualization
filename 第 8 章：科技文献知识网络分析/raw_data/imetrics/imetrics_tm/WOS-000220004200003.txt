Processes and technology of reciprocating internal combustion engines (ICE) constitute a research field whose characteristics regarding information production and diffusion are determined by multidisciplinarity, the existence of pseudo-technical literature and the influence of confidentiality on the presentation of research outputs. The objective of this study is to provide a quantitative and objective basis for the evaluation of research in this field. This has been accomplished by identifying the most productive journals and the most cited sources, using the SCI and citation analysis. From this analysis, core journals have been identified, showing that their importance in this research area does not correlate with their impact factor. Moreover, conference proceedings (particularly those published by the Society of Automotive Engineers) are shown to be the most important information source in this field.
