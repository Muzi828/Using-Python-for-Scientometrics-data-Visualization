A new indirect indicator is introduced for the assessment of scientific publications. The proposed indicator (-index) takes into account both the direct and indirect impact of scientific publications and their age. The indicator builds on the concept of generations of citations and acts as a measure of the accumulated impact of each scientific publication. A number of cases are examined that demonstrate the way the indicator behaves under well defined conditions in a Paper-Citation graph, like when a paper is cited by a highly cited paper, when cycles exist and when self-citations and chords are examined. Two new indicators for the assessment of authors are also proposed (fa-index and fas-index) that utilize the -index values of the scientific publications included in the Publication Record of an author. Finally, a comparative study of the and indices and a list of well known direct (Number of Citations, Mean number of citations, Contemporary h-index) and indirect (PageRank, SCEAS) indicators is presented.
