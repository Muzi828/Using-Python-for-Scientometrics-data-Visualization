An intellectual property (IP)-centric, communication-based Innovation Agenda is proposed and investigated. The agenda, which is aligned with IP legal prescription, is defined as follows: the firm's R&D expenditure is captured within products. The firm applies for a patent and files a trademark to protect its interests in the 'patentable' product, and issues a media communication, which may alter the perception of future cash flows, and thereby market price. Upon patent issuance and trademark registration, the firm will then seek another media communication. Spearman (partial) correlation analysis shows strong correlation among the various proxy metrics suggesting that the model basis may exist. The model proposes a novel link among national socioeconomic metrics, corporate strategy, and the technology based innovative firm. Finally, the model supports the inclusion of trademark and media communications data to be considered in socioeconomic modeling.
