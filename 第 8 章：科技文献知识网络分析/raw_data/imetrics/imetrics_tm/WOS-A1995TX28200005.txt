The UK Department of the Environment is responsible for a range of policy issues within Government related to many aspects of the environment in its broadest sense. It spends about pound 100 M annually on Science and Technology in support of its policy functions. Over recent years a system of research assessment has been established which consists of the development of ROAME statements for the appraisal of programmes and regular independent evaluation of the success and impact of the research on the basis of a five year cycle. The mechanisms and process of the assessment system are described. Effective evaluation of policy-oriented research programmes has provided valuable information to the Department on the success and impact of the research, and guidance on future direction and balance of the programmes.
