We show that inventive productivity can be described by two variables, Frequency and Lifetime. For several samples of inventors, we show that the Exponential and Generalized Pareto distributions provide excellent goodness-of-fit to these variables. Furthermore, good fits to these distributions arises naturally from the statistics of exceedances. Thus, a better theoretical foundation and connection to environmental variables is shown for Frequency and Lifetime than has been shown for Lotka's Law.
