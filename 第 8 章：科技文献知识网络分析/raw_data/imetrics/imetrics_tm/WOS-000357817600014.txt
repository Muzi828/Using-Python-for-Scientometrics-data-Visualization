The emergence of immersive documents, which allow the reader to perceive unreality as real, is foreseen. This new type of document will evolve from the combination of contemporary participatory, transmedia storytelling with pervasive computing technologies and multisensory interfaces. It is argued that a research program within library and information science is needed, to investigate new information behaviors associated with such documents, the new digital literacies needed to make effective use of them, and their place in the information communication chain.
