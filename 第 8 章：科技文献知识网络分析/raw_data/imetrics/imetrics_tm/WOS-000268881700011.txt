A bibliometric analysis was performed on a set of 1718 documents relating to Web 2.0 to explore the dimensions and characteristics of this emerging field. It has been found that Web 2.0 has its root deep in social networks with medicine and sociology as the major contributing disciplines to the scholarly publications beyond its technology backbone - information and computer science. Terms germane to Web 2.0, extracted from the data collected in this study, were also visualized to reflect the very nature of this rising star on the Internet. Web 2.0, according to the current research, is of the user, by the user, and more importantly, for the user.
