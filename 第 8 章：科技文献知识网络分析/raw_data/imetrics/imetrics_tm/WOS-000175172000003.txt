The stochastic model proposed recently by the author to describe the citation process in the presence of obsolescence is further investigated to illustrate the nth-citation distribution and the distribution of the total number of citations. The particular case where the latent rate has a gamma distribution is analysed in detail and is shown to be able to agree well with empirical data.
