Carbon nanotube field emission display (CNT-FED) represents both emerging application of nanotechnology and revolutionary invention of display. Therefore, it is an important subject to monitor the states and trends of CNT-FED technology before the next stage of development. The present paper uses patent bibliometric analysis and patent network analysis to monitor the technological trends in the field of CNT-FED. These results firstly reveal the different aspects of patenting activities in the field of CNT-FED. Then, patent network analysis indicates the developing tendency of worldwide FED production based on the synthesis of CNT materials. Furthermore, key technologies of three clusters can be identified as the depositing CNT on substrate, coating phosphor on screen and assembling process for whole device. Finally, emitter material is taken for the key factor in R&D work to improve the efficacy in CNT-FED technology.
