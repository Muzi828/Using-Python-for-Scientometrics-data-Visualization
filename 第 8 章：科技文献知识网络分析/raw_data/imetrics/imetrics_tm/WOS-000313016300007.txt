This paper borrows Strogatz's dynamic model for love affair between Romeo and Juliet and extends this model to nonlinear simultaneous differential equations model in order that we can characterize the dynamic interaction mechanisms and styles between science and technology (S&T). Then we further apply the proposed new model to the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology (N&N) for the purpose of analyzing the reciprocal dependence between S&T. The empirical results provide an understanding of the relationship between S&T and their dynamic potential of interdependence in the selected 20 leading universities in the field of N&N. We find that at present nanotechnology depends mainly on the scientific-push rather than the technology-pull and nanotechnology is science-based field. In contrast, a parallel development of the technology is not visible. Policy implications are at last put forward based on the several interesting findings for the interaction mechanisms between S&T in the field.
