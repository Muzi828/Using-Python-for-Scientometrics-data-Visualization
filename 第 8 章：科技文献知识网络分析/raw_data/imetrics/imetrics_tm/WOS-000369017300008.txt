We analyze the distributions of paper-paper and paper-patent citations and estimate the relationship between them, based on a 4763-paper sample among the top 100 researchers in the life and medical sciences fields in Japan. We find that paper-paper citations peak at a 4-year average, while the corresponding lag for paper-patent citations is 6 years. Moreover, we show that paper quality is important for being cited by a patent. An inverse U-shaped relationship exists between the research grant and research quality, whereas a U-shaped relationship exists between research quality and total number of papers.
