The Libernian-Wolf bonding number can not be considered as an acceptable measure for the internal bonding of a research group or community. This is shown by a construction where adding the same number of articles with the same number of co-authors to two existing groups (with a given number of articles with one or two collaborators) reverses the original order in these groups' bonding numbers.
