The 598 papers on physics published between 1987 and 1994 with at least one author presenting Chilean affiliation are scrutinized. Several aspects are cross-examined along the period of eight years: number of papers, cumulative impact factor, average impact factor, international co-authorship, most visited journals and main Chilean institutions. it is found that physics is growing in Chile with international collaboration playing an important role. The average impact factor is relatively high and rather constant throughout the period reflecting that the good level of Chilean physics is stable. The articles spread in 165 different journals, but most of the productivity is to be found in a Few journals of high impact factor. Most of the research is done by institutions in Santiago but other emerging institutions are also identified.
