In the present study we have tried to trace the growth of malaria research at Global Level and the distribution of articles in various journals for the period 1955-2005. The data have been extracted from a database, which has been developed in-house from MEDLINE, SCI, TDB, Ovid Heath Information and Indian Science Abstracts. Study indicates that the exponential model fits the data on journals, articles and authors. The R(2) value for the trend for journals, articles, and authors are 0.9502, 0.9475, and 0.9651, respectively. The growth rates for journals, articles and authors are 5.31%, 7.38%, and 10.06%, respectively. The linear multiple regression equation that Articles =-39.2771 + 3.61719*journals + 0.085882*Authors (R(2) = 99.16%) is most meaningful and it may be used to estimate the articles for given numbers of journals and authors.
