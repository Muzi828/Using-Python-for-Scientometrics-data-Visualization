According to the bibliographical data included in the Web of Science, SCOPUS, Chemical Abstracts, and other specialized information services covering the period 19001950, the first publications in mainstream journals by Mexican researchers appeared only in the first decades of the 20th century. Contrary to expectations, we find that the academic community was not the protagonist in the early stages of Mexican scientific practices, but that there was a strong contribution coming from researchers associated with the public-health sector and the chemical and mining industries. We were able to identify in this half century four different modes of scientific production: amateur, institutional, academic, and industrial, which in turn correspond to distinct stages in the evolution of the Mexican scientific production. We characterize these modes of production with a variety of indicators: publication and citation patterns, author output, journal and subject categories, institutional collaborations, and geographical distribution.
