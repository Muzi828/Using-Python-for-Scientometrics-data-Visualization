The paper presents a comparative analysis of publications, co-authored by Polish and foreign researchers, selected from seven annual files of Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index (CD-ROM Editions 1992-1998).
Information obtained from SCI and SSCI were elaborated, completed, coded and entered in two-international files" designed for analytical purposes.
It was found that the number of internationally co-authored papers was many times higher (18 982 records) in science than in social sciences (342 records). The share of these,international papers" in the "Polish files" increased in the time under review, but for those derived from SCI was also higher (39.1-46.0%) than in case of SSCI (22.4-37.0%).
Results of the analysis include countries of foreign partners and affiliation of domestic coauthors, as well as, subject structure of both international files.
Observed differences in the scale of international co-operation in science and in social sciences are being the matter under discussion.
