A framework is proposed for comparing different types of bibliometric indicators, introducing the notion of an Indicator Comparison Report. It provides a comprehensive overview of the main differences and similarities of indicators. The comparison shows both the strong points and the limitations of each of the indicators at stake, rather than over-promoting one indicator and ignoring the benefits of alternative constructs. It focuses on base notions, assumptions, and application contexts, which makes it more intelligible to non-experts. As an illustration, a comparison report is presented for the original and the modified source normalized impact per paper indicator of journal citation impact (SNIP).
