LUC's research council stimulates research by allocating a part of its funds based on results. The output-financing scheme is presented and its role in the university's research policy is explained. It is shown how this works in practice. An important aspect is that not only articles in JCR-covered journals are included but also other publications. This scheme together with a full-scale scientometric study forms two important aspects (short term versus medium term) of the university's research evaluation exercise. Its success is largely due to a general acceptance by the: scientists.
