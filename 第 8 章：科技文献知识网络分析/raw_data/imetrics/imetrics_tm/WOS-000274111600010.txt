One of the more important measures of a scholar's research impact is the number of times that the scholar's work is cited by other researchers as a source of knowledge. This paper conducts a first of its kind examination on Israel's academic economists and economics departments, ranking them according to the number of citations on their work. It also provides a vista into one of the primary reasons given by junior Israeli economists for an unparalleled brain drain from the country-discrepancies between research impact and promotion. The type of examination carried out in this paper can now be easily replicated in other fields and in other countries utilizing freely available citations data and compilation software that have been made readily accessible in recent years.
