SCI has been popular all over the world since it was published by Garfield in 1963. Researches on evaluating a researcher's output with SCI have always been continuous. In recent years, a great breakthrough has been made since the h-index was put forward in 2005. In this paper, we also advance a new method - Paper Quality Index (PQI) to evaluate the output of a researcher. The main purpose of our method is to solve two problems that consist in the method of h-index: one is that the h-index can't compare the outputs of researchers in different fields; the other is that it is unsuitable for evaluating the outputs of young researchers. A simple mathematical expression is constructed to eliminate the difference of citation among different fields and makes the evaluation of short-term outputs of researchers possible.
