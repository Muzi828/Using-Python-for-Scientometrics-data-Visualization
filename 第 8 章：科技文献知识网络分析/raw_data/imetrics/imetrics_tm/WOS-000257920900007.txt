User satisfaction has become one of the most important measures of the success or effectiveness of information systems (IS). In the current study, the dimensionality of Web-based information systems (WIS) satisfaction was first examined. Two composite latent variable models with factor-order structures were then empirically tested and compared to describe the relationships among observable variables concerned with WIS satisfaction. Using data from a sample of 515 university students, a third-order composite latent variable model was retained based on statistical and theoretical criteria. At the third-order level, WIS satisfaction is determined by two second-order constructs: Web information satisfaction and Web system satisfaction. Web information satisfaction is determined by understandability, reliability, and usefulness, while Web system satisfaction is determined by access, usability, and navigation. Overall, the model provides a good fit to the data and is theoretically valid, reflecting logical consistency. Implications of the current investigation for practice and research are provided.
