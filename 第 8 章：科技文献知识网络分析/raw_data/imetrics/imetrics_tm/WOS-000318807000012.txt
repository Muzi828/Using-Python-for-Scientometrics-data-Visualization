Traditional bibliometric indicators are considered too limited for some research areas such as humanities and social sciences because they mostly reveal a specific aspect of academic performance (quantity of publications) and tend to ignore a significant part of research production. The frequent misuses (e.g. improper generalizations) of bibliometric measures results in a substantial part of the research community failing to consider the exact nature of bibliometric measures. This study investigates the links between practices for assessing academic performance, bibliometric methods' use and underlying values of research quality within the scientific community of University of Lausanne, Switzerland. Findings reveal four researcher profiles depending on research orientations and goals, ranging from those using "pure" quantitative tools to those using more subjective and personal techniques. Each profile is characterized according to disciplinary affiliation, tenure, academic function as well as commitment to quality values.
