The importance of the convergent approach to technology development has increased recently. Therefore, understanding the characteristics of technology convergence, which refers to the combination of two or more technological elements in order to create a new system with new functions, is an important issue not only for researchers in technology development, but also for company directors for their successful management of product competitiveness. Therefore, in order to investigate the patterns and the mechanism of technological convergence, we examine the printed electronics technology which has typical characteristics of technology convergence. Based on the printed electronics-related patents registered between 1976 and 2012, we perform network analysis of the technology components in order to identify key technologies which played a central role among the groups of convergence technologies and to examine their dynamic role corresponding to the development of technology convergence. The results show that control technologies which control the role of other technologies over the technology convergence process play significant role. The centrality value is highest in the case of control technology, and devices related technologies have the largest number of patents quantitatively, thereby confirming the results. In addition, the trajectory analysis of the centrality value reveals a co-evolution pattern in technology convergence.
