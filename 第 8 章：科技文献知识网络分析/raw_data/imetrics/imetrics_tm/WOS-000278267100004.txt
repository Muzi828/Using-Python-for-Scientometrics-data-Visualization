We introduce the dominance dimension principle and the parameterized family of criteria for the assessment of publication/citation profiles it generates. We show that by a suitable choice of parameters dominance dimension may specialize to the most widely known and used of those impact scores for the scientific output of authors which disallow endogenous reputation effects, including the Durfee- or h-number, the publication number and the citation number.
