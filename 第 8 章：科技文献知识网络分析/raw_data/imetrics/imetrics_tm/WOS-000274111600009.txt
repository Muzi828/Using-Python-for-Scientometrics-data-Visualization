A large part of Social Sciences and the Humanities do not adapt to international proceedings used in English for scientific output on databases such as the Web of Science and Scopus. The aim of this paper is to show the different results obtained in scientific work by comparing Social Sciences researchers with those of other sciences in four Spanish universities. The first finding is that some Social Sciences researchers are somewhat internationalised. However, the majority of individuals who are prestigious in their local academic-scientific community do not even appear on the information sources mentioned above.
