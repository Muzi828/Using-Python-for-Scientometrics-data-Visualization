This investigation tries to determine if, for highly visible journals, namely Nature, Science and Cell, articles with a short editorial delay time generally, receive more citations than those with a long editorial delay. Based on data for the period from 2005 to 2009, it is found that there is a clear, although statistically weak, tendency for an inverse relation between editorial delay time and number of received citations.
