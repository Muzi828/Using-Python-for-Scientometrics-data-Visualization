As a first element of a macro-level country-by-country cross-reference and cross-citation analysis, domestic/international character of reference and citation behavior of 36 countries is studied and compared with international co-authorship patterns. Indicators of reference and citation domesticity as well as reference-citation domesticity balance are constructed and presented. Science policy relevance of these indicators is discussed and examples deserving science policy attention are pinpointed.
