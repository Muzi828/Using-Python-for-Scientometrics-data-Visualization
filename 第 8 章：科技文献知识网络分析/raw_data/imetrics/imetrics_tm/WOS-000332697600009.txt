The literature on the characteristics of the Triple Helix (TH) and university-industry-government relationships has not sufficiently shared research on this topic in Asia. Based on the assumption that the literature does not provide a sufficient overview of the sparse and complex yet diverse process of TH research in Asia, this study examines the characteristics of TH scholars such as their affiliations, preferred journals, international linkage patterns, and semantic discourse networks by analyzing their research articles. The results identify the most prominent TH scholars, journals, issues, and research trends in Asia and suggest a need for deeper and more creative analyses of the TH model in the region and for longer time periods for longitudinal analyses.
