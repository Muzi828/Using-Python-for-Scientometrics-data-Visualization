This paper seeks to describe the social circles, networks, or invisible colleges etc that make up a scientific speciality in terms of (mathematically precise) sets generated by documents citation and accessible through the Social Science Citation Index(TM). The document and author sets that encompass a scientific speciality are the basis for some interdependent citation matrices. We illustrate our method of construction of these sets and matrices through an application to the literature on ''invisible colleges''.
