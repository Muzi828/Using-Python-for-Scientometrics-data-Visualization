Two kinds of bibliographic tools are used to retrieve scientific publications and make them available online. For one kind, access is free as they store information made publicly available online. For the other kind, access fees are required as they are compiled on information provided by the major publishers of scientific literature. The former can easily be interfered with, but it is generally assumed that the latter guarantee the integrity of the data they sell. Unfortunately, duplicate and fake publications are appearing in scientific conferences and, as a result, in the bibliographic services. We demonstrate a software method of detecting these duplicate and fake publications. Both the free services (such as Google Scholar and DBLP) and the charged-for services (such as IEEE Xplore) accept and index these publications.
