Devising an index to measure the quality of research is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a set of indices to evaluate the quality of research produced by an author. Our indices utilize a policy that assigns the weights to multiple authors of a paper. We have considered two weight assignment policies: positionally weighted and equally weighted. We propose two classes of weighted indices: weighted h-indices and weighted citation h-cuts. Further, we compare our weighted h-indices with the original h-index for a selected set of authors. As opposed to h-index, our weighted h-indices take into account the weighted contributions of individual authors in multi-authored papers, and may serve as an improvement over h-index. The other class of weighted indices that we call weighted citation h-cuts take into account the number of citations that are in excess of those required to compute the index, and may serve as a supplement to h-index or its variants.
