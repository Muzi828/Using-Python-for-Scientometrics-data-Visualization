Analysis of scientific production is made in the domains of vaccines for the period 1990-1995, including eight Iberian-American countries. To attain the results, different indicators were applied such as: collaboration rate, activity index and representation techniques, using a cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling. Similarities between countries are represented according to their activity index in the subject field.
