The paper discusses the application of three well known diffusion models and their modified versions to the growth of publication data in four selected fields of S&T. It is observed that ail the three models in their modified versions generally improve their performance in terms of parameter values, fit statistics, and graphical fit to the data. The most appropriate model is generally seen to be the modified exponential-logistic model.
