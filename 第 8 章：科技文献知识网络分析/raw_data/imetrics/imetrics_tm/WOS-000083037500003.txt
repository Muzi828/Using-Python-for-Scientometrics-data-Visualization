An analysis of 4650 publications abstracted in Journal of Current Laser Abstracts (JCLA) during April 1990 - March 1991 indicates that 50 institutions located in 14 countries contributed about 39% of the S&T output. Twenty two of these institutions were from the USA, four each from Japan and the former USSR. Academic and research institutions were mainly concentrating their research efforts either in theoretical or experimental laser research. However, the industrial houses pursued their research in applications of the lasers. Most of these institutions published their output in scientific journals, but a few institutions had large amounts of technical reports and patents to their credit. Most of the institutions resembled in their activity and attractivity profiles. The values of normalized impact per paper, publication effectivity index and proportion of high quality papers for 12 institutions were less than average.
