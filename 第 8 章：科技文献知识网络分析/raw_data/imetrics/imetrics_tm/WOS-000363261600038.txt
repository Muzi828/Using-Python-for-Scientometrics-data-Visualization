This study explores current collaboration trend between industry and academic institutions in fuel cells by examining collaborative papers and patents during the period 1991-2010. Papers and patents from industry-academia collaboration (IAC) are identified; the quantity, ratio, and their origins are analyzed; and the differences in performance of these collaborative documents between academic institutions and industrial institutions are contrasted. This study finds that quantities of industry-academia collaborative papers and patents increased annually in both academic institutions and industrial institutions. Countries with high production of papers and patents tend to produce more industry-academia collaborative papers and patents. Industrial institutions with high patent output and academic institutions with high paper output are active participants in IAC paper collaborations. Only a few pairs of industry-academic alliances have taken active part in IAC patent collaborations. Industry relies highly on collaboration with academia in paper publishing, but not in patenting, while academic institutions rarely rely on industry collaboration for paper or patent productivity.
