In recent years there have been few bibliometric evaluations in dental sciences with an international approach. The aim of this study is to describe the scientific production of original and review articles published in ISI dental journals for the period 2007-2011, considering qualitative and quantitative measures across countries. In this study documents indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded of Web of Science were reviewed between January 2007 and December 2011. All "Article" and "Review" document types in the "Dentistry, Oral Medicine and Surgery" category were included. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed. A total of 37,571 documents were found for the entire period, growing 24.3 % annually from 2007 to 2011. The publication language was mostly English (98.6 %), and 54.5 % of productivity was concentrated in five countries. A total of 44 countries had at least 100 documents and were included in the analysis, representing 36,532 (97.23 %) documents. It was concluded that increasing productivity in some countries, such as Brazil, China, India, and Turkey, was observed. High levels and stability in terms of impact was determined in the Nordic countries. The USA continues to lead in terms of overall productivity.
