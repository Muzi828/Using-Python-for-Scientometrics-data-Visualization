This paper reports results from an exploratory study investigating the factors affecting student learning outcomes of information literacy instruction (ILI) given at business schools. Specifically, the potential influence of student demographics, learning environment factors, and information literacy program components on behavioral, psychological, and benefit outcomes were examined. In total, 79 interviews with library administrators, librarians, teaching faculty, and students were conducted at three business schools with varying ILI emphases and characteristics. During these interviews, participants discussed students' ILI experiences and the outcomes arising from those experiences. Data collection also involved application of a standardized information literacy testing instrument that measures student information literacy competency. Analysis yielded the generation of a new holistic theoretical model based on information literacy and educational assessment theories. The model identifies potential salient factors of the learning environment, information literacy program components, and student demographics that may affect ILI student learning outcomes. Recommendations for practice and implications for future research are also made.
