Comparative assessment of the journal literature produced by laboratories/institutions working in different fields is a difficult exercise. The impact factor of the journals is not a suitable indicator since citation practices vary with fields. The variation is corrected in this study using a measure, the "subfield corrected impact factor" and it is applied to the journal papers produced by the Indian Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Laboratories. This measure helped to compare the impact of journal literature in different fields.
