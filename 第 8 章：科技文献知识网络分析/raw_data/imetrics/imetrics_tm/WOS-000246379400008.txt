In this article, the author examines an enterprise resource planning (ERP) adoption process in a particular case setting to explore the knowledge management challenges encountered, specifically challenges related to the sharing and integration of knowledge, and the ways that social capital is used to overcome these challenges. More specifically, the author relates the different sources and effects of social capital to the different implementation phases, with their differing knowledge management challenges. By doing so, he highlights the relative importance of the bridging and bonding aspects of social capital that vary during different phases because of the different types of knowledge that become more or less important over the lifecycle of the project - embrained, embodied, encultured, embedded, and encoded.
