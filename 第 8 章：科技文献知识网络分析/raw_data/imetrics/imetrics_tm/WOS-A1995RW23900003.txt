The paper examines the bibliometric characteristics of industrial research activity of India. The study reveals that public-funded R&D is the major contributor of research papers, in Research & Industry while the contribution of in-house R&D centres is lacking. Among the two industrial sectors (Chemical and Engineering), much of the R&D activity, as reflected by published papers, has been in chemical and allied industries. However, there appears to be a significant change in emphasis during the decade studied, namely a decrease in R&D activity in engineering industries with a corresponding increase in 'miscellaneous' industries. There is a significant increase in exploratory research. R&D and industry interface is found inadequate. Multiplicity of authorship is gradually increasing. Indian Industrial research is heavily dependent on foreign and non-patent literature.
