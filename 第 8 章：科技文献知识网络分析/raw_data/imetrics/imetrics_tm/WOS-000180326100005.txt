This paper describes results of a scientometric study of the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB). The purpose of the study is to evaluate the research performance of IMCB in the first ten years since its establishment. Research inputs and three research outputs - publications, graduate students, and patents filed, are examined. The findings indicate that in the ten years, IMCB produced 395 research papers, 33 book chapters, 24 conference papers, and 4 monographs, graduated 46 PhDs and 14 MScs, and filed 10 patents. In its quest to become world-class, IMCB researchers have been very selective in where they publish - 95.6% of the articles were published in ISI journals. The articles received an average of 25 to 35 citations per article, and the percentage of uncited articles is 11.6%. Four articles received more than 200 citations, and 18 received between 100 to 200 citations.
