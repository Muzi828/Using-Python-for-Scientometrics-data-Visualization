The number of citations of journal papers is an important measure of the impact of research. Thus, the modeling of citation behavior needs attention. Burrell, Egghe, Rousseau and others pioneered this type of modeling. Several models have been proposed for the citation distribution. In this note, we derive the most comprehensive collection of formulas for the citation distribution, covering some 17 flexible families. The corresponding estimation procedures are also derived by the method of moments. We feel that this work could serve as a useful reference for the modeling of citation behavior.
