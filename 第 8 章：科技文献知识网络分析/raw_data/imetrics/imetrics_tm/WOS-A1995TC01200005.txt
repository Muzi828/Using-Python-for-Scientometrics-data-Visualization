This work reports the first results of a research in progress on the production, dissemination and impact of the literature on primary health care (PHC), as produced in Mexico during the period 1980-1992. The methodology used involved computerized searches in the MEDLINE, LILACS, and PERIODICA databases to identify the existing Mexican literature in the field. Results indicated a limited dissemination of the Mexican production through conventional databases. A total of 117 references were found in the field. Most of these references (72.65%) corresponded to journal articles. Over 55% of the documents were published by more than one author. Further research in the field as well as the implications of these results to PHC in Mexico are discussed by the author.
