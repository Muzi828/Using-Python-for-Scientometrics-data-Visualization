We show that the composition of two information production processes (IPPs), where the items of the first IPP are the sources of the second, and where the ranks of the sources in the first IPP agree with the ranks of the sources in the second IPP, yields an IPP which is positively reinforced with respect to the first IPP. This means that the rank-frequency distribution of the composition is the composition of the rank-frequency distribution of the first IPP and an increasing function phi, which is explicitly calculable from the two IPPs' distributions.
From the rank-frequency distribution of the composition, we derive its size-frequency distribution in terms of the size-frequency distribution of the first IPP and of the function phi.
The paper also relates the concentration of the reinforced IPP to that of the original one.
This theory solves part of the problem of the determination of a third IPP from two given ones (so-called three-dimensional informetrics). In this paper we solved the "linear" case, i.e., where the third IPP is the composition of the other two IPPs.
