The co-word method (Leximappe programme) is used to illustrate the essential themes of international research based on the computer analysis of databases of scientific articles and patents.  Further, we illustrate that these themes often follow characteristic cycles.  Research projects submitted to a research funding organisation were subjected to a similar analysis.  It was then possible in one sense to evaluate the relevance of funding support, particularly in terms of the degree of maturity of international research.
