This work reports on the subject content analysis performed to 1323 records retrieved from international databases, related to the Mexican production on environmental health. The U.S. National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and BIREME's Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) were used as guiding tools to select the subject content of records. Overall, 97 descriptors were identified; 65 corresponded to MeSH terms and 32 were generated by the authors. Results indicated that most of the production was related to environmental pollution studies focused on water and air pollution, and environmental monitoring. Through the development of hierarchical models, patterns of subjects covered and uncovered could be easily identified. Further lines of action and research are proposed by the authors.
