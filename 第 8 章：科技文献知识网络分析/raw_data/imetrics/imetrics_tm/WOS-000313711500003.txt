We set out in the present study to examine 1997-2007 data on inventors, based upon country of residence, and on the process of co-invention, with the ultimate aim of undertaking analysis of the main partner countries currently collaborating with China in global technological production. Through our focus on China, we are able to demonstrate the evolving trend towards the establishment of collaborative patenting networks within an emerging market. In addition to exploring the pattern of joint international inventions, we link the patent data to other macro-economic factors for empirical analysis. Our results indicate that the relative manufacturing strength, the international trade exposure, and the respective economy standing have positive effect on the propensity for engaging in such international co-invention activities.
