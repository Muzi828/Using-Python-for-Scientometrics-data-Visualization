Three new metrics are introduced that measure the range of use of a university Web site by its peers through different heuristics for counting links targeted at its pages. All three give results that correlate significantly with the research productivity of the target institution. The directory range model, which is based upon summing the number of distinct directories targeted by each other university, produces the most promising results of any link metric yet. Based upon an analysis of changes between models, it is suggested that range models measure essentially the same quantity as their predecessors but are less susceptible to spurious causes of multiple links and are therefore more robust.
