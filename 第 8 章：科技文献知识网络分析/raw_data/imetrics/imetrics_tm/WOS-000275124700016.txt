Following up the European project PromTech the aim of which was to detect emerging technologies by studying the scientific literature, we chose one field, Molecular Biology, to identify and characterize emerging topics within that domain. We combined two analytical approaches: the first one introduces a model of the terminological evolution of the field based on bibliometric indicators and the second one operates a diachronic clustering analysis. Our objective is to bring answers to questions such as: Which technological aspects can be detected? Which of them are already established and which of them are new? How are the topics linked to each other?.
