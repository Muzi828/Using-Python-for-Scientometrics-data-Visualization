The aim is to investigate the cities based on the author-affiliation data from Web of Science, Biosis Previews, CAB Abstracts, Chemical Abstracts, Compendex/Inspec, Francis, Medline, Pascal, and Sociological Abstracts databases. Specifics of particular cities and publishing patterns and trends with reference to particular disciplines are studied. Characteristics of city-data collection with regard to retrieval accuracy are investigated. Databases are compared regarding document coverage and input consistency. A city as an emerging supranational unit is proposed as a scientometric object and indicator in its own right as a complement to the traditional notion of a country or a nation-state.
