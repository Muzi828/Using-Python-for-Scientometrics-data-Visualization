In this article, we propose to apply the topic model and topic-level eigenfactor (TEF) algorithm to assess the relative importance of academic entities including articles, authors, journals, and conferences. Scientific impact is measured by the biased PageRank score toward topics created by the latent topic model. The TEF metric considers the impact of an academic entity in multiple granular views as well as in a global view. Experiments on a computational linguistics corpus show that the method is a useful and promising measure to assess scientific impact.
