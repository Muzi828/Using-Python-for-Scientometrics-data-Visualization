This article reports the analysis of two samples of search logs from a commercial image provider over a 1-month period. The study analyzes image searches and queries, user query modification strategies, and user browsing and downloading of results. Unique term searches are less frequent than earlier research has shown; descriptive and thematic queries are more common. Boolean searching, although heavily employed, appears to be ineffective and leads to query modifications. Although there was a large amount of query modification (61.7% of queries across the two samples), the tactics overall do not appear to be carefully thought out and seem to be largely experimental. Given the willingness to modify queries but the inability to do so in an effective way, more support for query modification may be beneficial.
