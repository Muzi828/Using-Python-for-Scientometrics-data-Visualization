Does devoting more academic research resources promote academic quality? This study aims to examine the influence of higher education R&D expenditure (HERD) on academic quality measured by the relative citation impact (RCI). Both the ordered Probit and panel data models are employed to implement the empirical estimation, the cross-country evidence suggests that an increase in academic R&D is positively related to academic quality. The further analyses on different academic disciplines show the HERD is more relevant to science publications. This finding is robust for various specifications.
