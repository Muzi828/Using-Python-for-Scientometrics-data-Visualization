In 1985 China began the reform of its Science & Technology (S&T) sector inherited from the planned economy. To disclose the impact of the drawn-out reform on the efficiency of the whole sector, we measure the scientific productivity of China's S&T institutes. The analysis is based on R&D input and output data at the country aggregate and provincial level. We utilize Polynomial Distributed Lag model to uncover the structure of the lag between R&D input and output. The findings reveal that the growth rate of scientific productivity of China's S&T institutes has been negative since the 1990s.
