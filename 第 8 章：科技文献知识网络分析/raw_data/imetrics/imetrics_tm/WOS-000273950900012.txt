The objective of this research is to develop a new patent bibliometric performance measure by using modified citation rate analyses with dynamic backward citation windows. Cited half-life employed in bibliometrics was adopted in order to establish a model of annual patent backward citation windows. Based on the dynamic behavior of backward citation windows, the annual backward patent citation rates for each technology domain can be calculated to measure its bibliometric performance. It was found that the dynamic backward citation window represents more accurately the citation cycle time which is a key factor on technology assessment. Because different technology domain may have disparate attributes, a normalized backward citation rate was developed to measure the corresponding rank for each domain respect to the entire industry. Three technology domains were then chosen for demonstrative case studies which represent semiconductor, LCD, and drug industries.
