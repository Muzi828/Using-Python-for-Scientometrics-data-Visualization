This study aims to provide archiving research trends from the perspective of the field of library and information science using profiling analysis method. The LISA database has been selected as the representative database in the library and information science field, and articles have been searched via the keyword 'archiv*'. The analysis methods used in this study were the journal profiling method and the descriptor profiling method. The descriptor profiling method presents descriptors as a bag of words. That is, it represents descriptors according to the word sets which are included in the documents in which those descriptors are assigned. As a result of journal analysis, six representative journals which are closely related to archiv* have been identified. The six journals were Archivaria, Advanced Technology Libraries, Journal of the Society of Archivists, American Archivist, Archifacts, and Records Management Bulletin. The results of descriptor analysis show that the most comprehensive and core subject was digital libraries, and the most comprehensive and core object was the electronic media. Another result of detailed analysis shows that the outstanding objects were publications, special collections/sound, cultural heritage, television, image/photographs, internet/bibliographic data, and DB/newspapers. On the other hand, outstanding subjects were Archives, National Libraries, Universities, Libraries and companies.
