Bibliometric maps have the potential to become useful tools for science policy issues. The complexity of the structures, however, makes it often very difficult to interpret the results. In this study, we present a case study in which we use the bibliometric mapping results to address a high level science policy issue of research efficiency. By revealing the results in an alternative way, we increased the utility of bibliometric mapping within the science policy context. Moreover, by including additional information to the entities in the landscape, we provide useful input for the research potential.
