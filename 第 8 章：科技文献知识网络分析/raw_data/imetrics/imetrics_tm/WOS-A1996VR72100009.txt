This article presents a scientometric procedure which assists in the production of bibliometric indicators for conducting international comparisons about transdisciplinary research field. The procedure aims at the analysis of how a nomenclature in the field of the environment, established by public research administrators, translates into subsets of scientific journals. Relations between the nomenclature and scientific disciplines were obtained through analysis of reviews. The environmental field's structure has been analysed by using journal cross-citation data.
