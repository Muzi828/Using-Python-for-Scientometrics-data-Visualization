The study has tried to look at the political transition through the articles publisbed by Spanish scientists in Spanish journals of Social Sciences and Humanities. A sample of 11000 article references from a selected set of 32 journals published from 1976 till 1985, has been the basis of the analysis. This time frame has been divided into two 5 year periods in order to detect any change in the topics published. The result of the analysis has been compared with the ''events'' as recorded by ''El Pais'' a very popular newspaper, during the same 10 year period and with a set of specific articles devoted to the Spanish political transition.
