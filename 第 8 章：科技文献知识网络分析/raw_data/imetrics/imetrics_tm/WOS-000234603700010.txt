The paper discusses an application of bibliometric techniques in the social sciences. While the interest of policy makers is growing, the topic is getting more and more attention from bibliometricians. However, many efforts are put into developing tools to measure scientific output and impact outside the world of the Social Sciences Citation Index, while the use of the SSCI for bibliometric applications is covered with obscurity and myths. This study attempts to clarify some of the topics mentioned against the application of the SSCI for evaluation purposes. The study will cover topics like the existing publication and citation culture within the social sciences, the effect of variable citation windows, and the (geographical) origin of citation flows.
