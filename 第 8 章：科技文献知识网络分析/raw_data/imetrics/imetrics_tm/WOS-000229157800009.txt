Most of the science indicators used in the literature for characterizing the research activity and performance of nations are based on journal articles and citations. As an alternative we have examined the use of journal gatekeepers as real and useful science indicators. As an example, gatekeepers of some analytical chemistry core journals were used. To reveal the changes in the contributions of different nations to the field studied, a comparison has been made between the 1970-1974 and the 2002 data on gatekeepers of the same journals.
