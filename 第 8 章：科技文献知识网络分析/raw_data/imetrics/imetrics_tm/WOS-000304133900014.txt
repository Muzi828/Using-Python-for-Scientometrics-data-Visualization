This study evaluates the utility of a publication power approach (PPA) for assessing the quality of journals in the field of artificial intelligence. PPA is compared with the Thomson-Reuters Institute for Scientific Information (TR) 5-year and 2-year impact factors and with expert opinion. The ranking produced by the method under study is only partially correlated with citation-based measures (TR), but exhibits close agreement with expert survey rankings. A simple average of TR and power rankings results in a new ranking that is highly correlated with the expert survey rankings. This evidence suggests that power ranking can contribute to evaluating artificial intelligence journals.
