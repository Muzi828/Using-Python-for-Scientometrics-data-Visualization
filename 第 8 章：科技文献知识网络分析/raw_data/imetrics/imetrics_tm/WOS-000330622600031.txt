This paper concerns the development and use of a new interdisciplinary graphical approach in the statistical analysis of complexity of sentence structure for scientometric purposes. A scheme in three-dimensional space (barycentric plot) is used for a graphical representation of scientific research text correlations between the number of characters, the number of words, and the number of complex syllable words for sentences of several monolingual corpuses. The barycentric plots do not only drastically increase the visual information content in a given corpus, but at equal conditions of text-based corpus, they also contribute to the comparative analysis of different kinds of subject, section, author-style, journal, field, etc. As illustrated in present study, the proposed graphical approach can have broad implications and practical applications not only in scientometric field, but also in statistical linguistics, stylistic text research, and informetric research. This article explores the interdisciplinary approach research and applications of different areas of knowledge.
