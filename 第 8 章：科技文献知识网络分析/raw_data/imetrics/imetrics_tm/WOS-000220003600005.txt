In this article we present a precise definition of the notion "own-group preference" and characterize all functions capable of correctly measuring it. Examples of such functions are provided. The weighted Lorenz curve and the theory developed for it will be our main tools for reaching this goal. We further correct our earlier articles on this subject.
In the context of own-language preference, Bookstein and Yitzhaki proposed the logarithm of the odds-ratio as an acceptable measure of own-group preference. We now present a general framework within which the concept of own-group preference, and its opposite, namely own-group aversion, can be precisely pinpointed. This framework is derived form inequality theory and is based on the use of the weighted Lorenz curve.
The concept of own-group preference is an interesting notion with applications in different fields such as sociology, political sciences, economics, management science and of course, the information sciences. Some examples are provided.
