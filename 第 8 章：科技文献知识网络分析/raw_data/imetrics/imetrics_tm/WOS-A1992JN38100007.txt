This paper used data generated in a previous study to model what can be termed fast literature. In this case, the literature of superstring theory was examined to determine if an anomalous case, such as superstring literature, might fit a theoretical distribution. Price's Index was examined and found not to fit the data. The lognormal and the Weibull Distributions both appear to fit the observed distribution; however, the Weibull has better practical as well as theoretical strengths to model superstring literature. It is suggested that the literature of superstrings belongs in a separate class of literature, what we term fast literature. Additional study is indicated to determine if this type of literature is a significant factor in scientometrics.
