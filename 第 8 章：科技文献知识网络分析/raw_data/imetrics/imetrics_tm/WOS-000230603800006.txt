Today information-intensive work tasks in professional settings involve highly dynamic information utilization in which information seeking and searching tasks are taking a more central role. This article considers the concept of task in the context of information studies in order to provide a definitional clarity for task-based information seeking and retrieval studies. We identify (1) the central task levels as well as (2) the kinds of dimensions connected to the levels from the perspective of information studies. The analysis is aimed to serve as a conceptual starting point for empirical studies in the research area. The focus is on some central aspects of tasks that are recognized within information studies as well as related research areas (e.g., organizational studies). We define two levels of information-related subtasks: information seeking tasks and information search tasks. Information retrieval tasks are explicitly considered as a specific type of information search task. We describe differences and connections between these task levels. Finally, the implications of the proposed conceptual framework for information studies are discussed.
