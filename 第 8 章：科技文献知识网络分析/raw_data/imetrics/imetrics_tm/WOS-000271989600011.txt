I examine whether the professionalization of science, a process that unfolded between 1600 and 1899, afforded better opportunities for young scientists to make significant discoveries. My analysis suggests that the professionalization of the sciences did make it a little easier for scientists to make significant contributions at a younger age. But, I also argue that it is easy to exaggerate the effects of professionalization. Older and middle age scientists continued to play an important role in making significant discoveries throughout the history of modern science.
