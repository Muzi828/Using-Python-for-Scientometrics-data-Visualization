This article presents an overview of some of the methodology used in a project that examined children's understanding of library information and how those perspectives change in the first 5 years of formal schooling. Because our understanding of information is reflected in the manner in which we classify, or typify, that information in order to view the library collection from a child's perspective children were invited to shelve (i.e., classify) terms representative of library books and then to label those categories. The resulting shelf categories help us to see library information from a child's perspective. Data collection using group dialog, visual imagery, narrative, cooperative learning techniques, and hands-on manipulatives is described for one session of a project in which children used induction to form concepts related to knowledge organization in a hypothetical library. Analysis for this session included use of hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling to examine and compare children's constructions for qualitative differences on several grade levels. Following the description of data collection methods and analysis, a discussion focuses on the reasons for using these particular methods of data collection with a child population.
