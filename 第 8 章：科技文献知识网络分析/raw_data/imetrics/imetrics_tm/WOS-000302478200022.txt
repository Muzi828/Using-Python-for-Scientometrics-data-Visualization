While there is a consensus that there is a core-periphery structure in the global scientific enterprise, there have not been many methodologies developed for identifying this structure. This paper develops a methodology by looking at the differences in the power law structure of article outputs and degree centrality distributions of countries. This methodology is applied to five different scientific fields: astronomy and astrophysics, energy and fuels, nanotechnology and nanosciences, nutrition, and oceanography. This methodology uncovers a two-tiered power law structure that exists in all examined fields. The core-periphery structure that is unique to each field is characterized by the core's size, minimum degree, and exponent of its power law distribution. Stark differences are identified between technology and non-technology intensive scientific fields.
