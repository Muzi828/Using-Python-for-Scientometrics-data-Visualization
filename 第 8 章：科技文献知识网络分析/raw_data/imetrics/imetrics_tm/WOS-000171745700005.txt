This article is devoted to. the scientometric research of Professor V. V, Nalimov ( 1910-1997) of Moscow State University, His first scientometric article was published in 1959: mathematical models of world science growth were examined and logical grounds for the applicability of these models were also given, In his further works, V.V. Nalimov continued to stress the importance of quantitative studies of science development. In 1969, the monograph on scientometrics by V. V. Nalimov and his co-author Z. M. Mulchenko was published. This book reflected his earlier publications on scientometrics and the solutions of new tasks. In 1970, Nalimov published articles on the comparison of science and the biosphere, the geographic distribution of scientific information, and changes in the demand of scientific staff. In later articles in philosophy of science, he stressed the necessity of a combination of the scientometric approach with works on the logic of science development. One of the latest works by Nalimov was an analysis of articles published by The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology: Here the scientometric approach was used to study the origin and development of a new scientific branch.
