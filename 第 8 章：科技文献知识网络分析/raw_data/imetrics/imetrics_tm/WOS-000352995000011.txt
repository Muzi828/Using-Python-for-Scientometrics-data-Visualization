Ethnobiology is a clearly interdisciplinary field, with several connections to other research approaches, such as studies examining traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). The central question investigated is if Brazilian studies are disproportionately attached to the prefix "ethno" when compared to the profiles of other countries with high contributions to these scientific fields. I used a bibliometric review to investigate this question and discussed several outcomes of the resulting patterns. I retrieved 8470 articles, 6117 using keywords associated with TEK and 2954 using keywords associated with ethnobiology and related subfields. A unique scenario emerges only for Brazil, where there is a stronger attachment to the ethno prefix than the rest of the world, which reflects the history of these scientific approaches and the context of scientific production.
