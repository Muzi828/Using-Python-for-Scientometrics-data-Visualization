The article describes the project on music information retrieval that has been carried out at the University of Padova, Italy. The research work has been characterized by the synergy of the modular integration of sound techniques of melody processing and of statistical information retrieval. After illustrating the background from which the project has originated, we describe the complete process, from methodology design through evaluation and system implementation. Conclusions, impacts on research in music information retrieval, and future directions are also described.
