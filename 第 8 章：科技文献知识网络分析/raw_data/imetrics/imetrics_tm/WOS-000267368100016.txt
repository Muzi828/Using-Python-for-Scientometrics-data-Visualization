We apply social network analysis to display the characteristics of the networks resulting from bibliographic coupling of journals by the Chinese patent data of United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between 1995 and 2002. The networks of journals in all fields, the three strongly science-based fields (i.e. Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals, and Organic Fine Chemistry), and the three weakly science-based fields (i.e. Optics, Telecommunications, and Consumer Electronics), have been analyzed from the global and the ego views, respectively. We study a variety of statistical properties of our networks, including number of actors, number of edges, size of the giant component, density, mean degree, clustering coefficient and the centralization measures of the network. We also highlight some apparent differences in the network structure between the subjects studied. Besides, we use the three centrality measures, i.e. degree, closeness, and betweenness, to identify the important journals in the network of all fields and those strongly science-based networks.
