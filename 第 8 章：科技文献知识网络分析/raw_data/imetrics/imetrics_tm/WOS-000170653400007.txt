The relation between philosophy of science and epistemology is studied using the author co-citation technique. Co-citation links among 62 authors - a representative list of various styles and approaches to rationality - were established using the Arts and Humanities Citation Index. Multidimensional scaling results in a two-dimensional map of authors, where the axes represent the subject (philosophy of science to epistemology) and the method (qualitative to quantitative), respectively. The authors on the map can be clustered into more or less coherent groups at different levels of resolution.
