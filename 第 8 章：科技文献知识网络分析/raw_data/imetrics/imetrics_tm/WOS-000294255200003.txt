The overarching goal of this study is to place additional emphasis on the ability to observe, extend, and apply findings across different experimental studies and/or digital projects by providing further insight into some of the broader processes within interactive (user-centered) video retrieval. The variable at the center of this particular investigation included a user-centered definition of topic complexity, or "situated topic complexity," where its influence on other factors within the interactive video process, namely users' actions, satisfaction, performance, and judgments on other topical qualities, was analyzed. Findings revealed that as users' impressions of complexity increased during experimental search topics, search times and the number of user actions also increased, but even more compelling was the fact that users started to convincingly shift away from keyword (transcript) searching, as predominantly used for easy to moderate topics, to categorical and linear browse strategies at a clear point within the interactive process. Different users' assessments, regarding their search experiences, and topic performances were also varied and shown to be significantly correlated with the situated complexity of a given topic. Such findings are relevant to the design of digital libraries in that researchers should continue improving ways to deliver video through keyword search functions, but also further recognize the multidimensionality of video by offering other paths or interface options that provide support for highly complex needs and also for exploring the collection's boundaries on easier topics.
