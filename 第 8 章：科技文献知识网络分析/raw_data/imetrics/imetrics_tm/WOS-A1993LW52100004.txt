Thailand has a growing demand for improved science-based technologies in the agricultural sector. Traditionally strong in agricultural research, Thailand is encouraging agricultural applications of biotechnology through focused research funding. This article provides a brief account of the status of scientific research in the Thai orchid and seed industries, and examines communication behavior of researchers and innovators in Thai universities, research institutions and firms. Researchers produce relatively few written communications in tissue culture and seed technologies, and technology diffusion relies mainly on personal interactions between the researchers, intermediaries, and users of innovations.
