The three scientometric etudes presented in this paper are dealing with three aspects of science in developing countries:  (1) estimation of scientific manpower and publication potential is given using the Waring model of publication productivity; (2) co-authorship patterns are analyzed to conclude that local interactions among developing countries are dominant, but the historical-political-geographical connections are also vivid, and (3) a "quasi-4D comparison of socio-economic and scientometric indicators is presented using "Chernoff faces".
