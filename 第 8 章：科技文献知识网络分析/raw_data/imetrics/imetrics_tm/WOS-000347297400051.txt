We explore which innovation support infrastructures help Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) with research and technology (R&T) production and knowledge commercialisation. The objectives are to determine (1) the time required by innovation support infrastructures like science parks (SPs) to promote research activities and the factors that may influence it; and (2) if a HEI's R&T output and commercial performance are helped by innovation support infrastructures like SPs or incubators. The analysis is based upon publications produced by on-park firms (1975-2010), as well as patents and quantitative data from national HEIs with collaborative ties with 92 support infrastructures. Statistical analyses reveal that research parks & campuses and SPs are the infrastructures that are most likely to promote prompt R&T activities and University-Industry (U-I) collaboration for their residents and newer parks seem to be the most successful at encouraging U-I interactions. HEIs' efforts to exploit their academic research base through support infrastructures have no significant impact on the volume of patents or research publications produced by them, and on entrepreneurial activities with less institutionalised support, such as joint research, contract research or consultancy. However, relationships with SPs and incubators strongly associate with the commercial performance of universities in terms of their academic spin-offs and facilities and equipment services.
