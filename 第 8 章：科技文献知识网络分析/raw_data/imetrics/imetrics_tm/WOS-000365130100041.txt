This work studies the trends of co-author numbers in Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics, from 1960 to 2010. Journal data are analyzed to show the common trends across the disciplines. The single-author papers decline continuously over the years. The multi-author papers rise and fall following one another in succession. The data suggest that small-group collaborations in different disciplines go through the same stages at different times. Besides the common trends, the dramatic growth of the co-author number in Physics after 1990 is also discussed.
