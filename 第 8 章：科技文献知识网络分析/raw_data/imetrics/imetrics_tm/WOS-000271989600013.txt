The h-index is becoming a reference tool for career assessment and it is starting to be considered by some agencies and institutions in promotion, allocation, and funding decisions. In areas where h indices tend to be low, individuals with different research accomplishments may end up with the same h. This paper proposes a multidimensional extension of the h index in which the conventional h is only the first component. Additional components of the multidimensional index are obtained by computing the h-index for the subset of papers not considered in the immediately preceding component. Computation of the multidimensional index for 204 faculty members in Departments of Methodology of the Behavioral Sciences in Spain shows that individuals with the same h can indeed be distinguished by their values in the remaining components, and that the strength of the correlation of the second and third components of the multidimensional index with alternative bibliometric indicators is similar to that of the first component (i.e., the original h).
