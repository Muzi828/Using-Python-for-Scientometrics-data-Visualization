Number of published medical/dental articles is growing at an exponential rate; this makes it difficult to collect all these resources and provide an organized and valuable/useful document. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses as high-level evidences are considered remedies for this concern. Continuous alterations in all fields of dental sciences necessitate the more of such high-level evidences. This study aimed on the quantity of endodontic systematic reviews and meta-analyses so far. This study began with targeted electronic searches of PubMed, and Cochrane library databases about the present systematic review and meta-analysis articles in endodontics within 2001-Jan 2012. Overall, 49 studies were systematic review and meta-analysis, the first comprised 34 articles and the latter contained seven articles; the remained eight studies had utilized both of them. Performing a topic sorting, 22 articles were about materials and techniques, 12 about pre- and post-treatment considerations, four about single/multiple visits, six with perio-prostho themes, and the five remained were of other topics. Limited number of 49 high-level evidences does not meet the expectation from endodontics as a boundless and progressive field of science. Therefore, more comprehensive and all-inclusive studies of systematic reviews and meta-analyses are compulsory in endodontics. The more the scientific-based endodontic practice, the more the high-level evidence based publications with good systematic reviews and favorable meta-analysis.
