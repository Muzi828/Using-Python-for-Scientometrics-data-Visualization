This article provides an overview of our experiments in using MPEG-7 in a television news retrieval application. Our study is based on a survey of professional users in the Television Suisse Romande (TSR) television news production environment. We present here two main issues. First, we describe the way the generic and voluminous MPEG-7 Schema can be exploited in the context of a specific application domain. Second, we discuss the problem of how to search MPEG-7 descriptions, which are detailed and complex by nature, via a high-level user-oriented retrieval model.
