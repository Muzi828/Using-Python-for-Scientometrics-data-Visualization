Journals are increasingly making use of online supplemental information (OSI) as a means to convey part of the material previously included in the papers themselves. Quite often, material displaced to OSI is accompanied by references that, with rare exceptions, are not incorporated into citation databases. An analysis of OSI in a random sample of papers published in 2013 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA revealed that unique references only listed in OSI amount to more than 10 % of the number of references included in the papers themselves. Obliteration of these references in citation databases contributes to substantial inaccuracies in citation counts, with a bias against papers that are cited only in the methods sections usually displaced to OSI.
