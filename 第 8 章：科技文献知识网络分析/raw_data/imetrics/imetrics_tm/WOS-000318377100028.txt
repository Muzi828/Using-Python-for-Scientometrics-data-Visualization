This paper applies the Ijiri-Simon test for systematic deviations from Gibrat's law to citation numbers of economists. It is found that often-cited researchers attract new citation numbers that are disproportionate to the quality of their work. It is also found that this Matthew effect is stronger for economists who started their academic career earlier. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
