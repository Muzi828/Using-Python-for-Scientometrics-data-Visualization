The present paper introduces two independent concepts. X-centage is a statistical indicator characterizing distributions of percentage-valued variables in a vein similar to Hirsch's h-index. Heterodisciplinarity is a measure of polydisciplinarity using the disciplinary categorization of references and/or citations. The Journal Citation Reports database is used for an empirical study of using the X-centage for measuring reference heterodisciplinarity of science fields.
