Results are given of a bibliometric study covering 1977-86 and 28 scientific fields defined by journals and title keywords.  Attention was focussed on publications from less favoured regions of the EC, containing 20% of the population, 10% of the g.d.p., but only 5% of scientific output, although this is growing rapidly.  The scientific strengths of the different LFRs vary and details are given.  Finally, some appropriate indicators are suggested to measure the effectiveness of scientific infrastructure support planned for these regions.
