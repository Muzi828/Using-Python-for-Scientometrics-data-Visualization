Bradford's law, perhaps the most well known of the Informetric regularities, analyzes the scattering of articles in a single discipline over journals. Yet journals are multi-disciplinary entities. This paper discusses the implications for Bradford's law of the multi-disciplinary character of journals, and defines a simple model that indicates the evolution of journals as a competition among subjects for space.
