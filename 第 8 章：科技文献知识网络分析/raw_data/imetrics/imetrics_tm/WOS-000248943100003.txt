The increase in patents is a main driving force for discussions of international competitiveness, knowledge spillovers, patent office efficiencies, and others. However, to the author's knowledge, it is interesting that no work has investigated the impact of the growth in the number of patents on patent-related scholarly (peer-reviewed) and media (e.g., press release) literatures, or evidence of inter-relatedness among these three literatures with those of the US market indices (viz., Dow, S&P500, NASDAQ). Here, I report that the growth in the number of US issued patents, the patent-related media and peer-reviewed publications, and these indices are statistically correlated, but with drastically different growth rates. This general result affords data supporting a hypothesis that publicly traded companies, as drivers of innovation, are priming a new research area within the scholarly communities and simultaneously affecting market value through, what-may-be-called, "patent journalism.".
