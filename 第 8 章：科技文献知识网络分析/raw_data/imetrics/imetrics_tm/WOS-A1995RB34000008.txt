The purpose of this paper is to study the referee systems of foreign scientific journals in the field of life sciences preferred by Japanese researchers. This survey has been conducted in response to the need of Japanese authors for current information about the refereeing systems of foreign life science journals. Based on questionnaire data obtained from 29 journal editors, this paper describes the refereeing systems. This survey showed that most Japanese researchers in the field of life sciences tried to submit their papers to prestigious foreign journals with a higher rejection rate. There was a high correlation between the rejection rate and the impact factor in the field of biochemistry and molecular biology.
