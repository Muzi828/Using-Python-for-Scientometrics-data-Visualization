The present study adopts an interpretive and situated approach to observe and assess learners' problem solving using hypermedia. The evaluation is conducted in context by considering the use of Perseus in particular learning situations. The study reflects on the design and use of hypermedia learning systems from both the learners' and researcher's perspective. The characteristics of Perseus are discussed together with some design recommendations for future consideration. Drawing from the study, conclusions are set out that highlight some implications for designers. It should be noted that the list of suggested features is not meant to be either definitive or exhaustive. The list is indicative of which design considerations should be addressed to improve Perseus hypermedia learning systems in the future. The researcher hopes that the findings of the study can help designers develop and refine better intellectual tools with which to augment learners' performance.
