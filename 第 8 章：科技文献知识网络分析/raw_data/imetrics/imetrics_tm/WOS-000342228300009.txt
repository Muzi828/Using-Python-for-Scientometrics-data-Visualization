How has the terrorism affected the research process and findings? The author tries to answer to this question through an exploratory analysis of the impact of these tragic events on the research outputs of scientists, institutions and countries. In particular, this report provides a wide range of scientometric data related to terrorism studies over the world during the two decades from 1991 to 2011. After the September 11, 2001 events (9/11) in the United States, the concerned academicians have responded in a way that they started producing an increasing number of research publications, as if they were under the influence of some kind of a driving force, stimulating the overall academic production linked to this tragic event. However, after this trend has reached its peak in 2002, that driving force has visibly weakened, and since the mid 2000's, the number of research publication in the field of terrorism studies has steadily decreased. Nonetheless, the number of terrorist events per year, along with the property damage and fatality rate, has continuously increased over the observed lapse of time. Using these results as a backdrop, in this paper is argued that the field of terrorism research should be explored from a critical and multi-cultural perspective, and that all scientific researchers should remain objective, for scientific research is to be independent from political systems, its contingent events in any form, and the transitory historical circumstances.
