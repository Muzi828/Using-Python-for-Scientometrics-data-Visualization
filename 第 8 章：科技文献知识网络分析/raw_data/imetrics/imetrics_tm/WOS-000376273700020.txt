In this work, we propose the graphical representation for the empirical data of the impact factor rank-ordered distribution. The characteristics of the distribution can be directly visualized. Within the subject category of journal citation reports, the impact factor rank-ordered distribution systematically presents a clear evidence of the two-exponent behavior and the S-shaped decrease. The sharp convex decrease is related to the first exponent, which dictates the distribution of lower ranks. The mild concave decrease is related to the second exponent, which dictates the distribution of higher ranks. The relevance of Matthew effect is discussed.
