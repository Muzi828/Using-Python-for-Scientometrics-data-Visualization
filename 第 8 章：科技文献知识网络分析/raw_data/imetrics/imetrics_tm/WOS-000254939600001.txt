This paper is an investigation of the knowledge sources of Korean innovation studies using citation analysis, based on a Korean database during 1993-2004. About two thirds of knowledge has come from foreign sources and 94% of them are from English materials. Research Policy is the most frequently cited journal followed by Harvard Business Review, R&D Management and American Economic Review. An analysis of who cites the most highly cited journal is also included. Neo-Schumpeterians in Korea cite more papers from Research Policy than general researchers, and there is no difference between groups in the year of citation.
