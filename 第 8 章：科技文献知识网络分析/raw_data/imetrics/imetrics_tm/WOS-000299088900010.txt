Two layers of enriched information are constructed for communities: a paper-to-paper network based on shared author relations and a paper-to-paper network based on shared word relations. k-means and VOSviewer, a modularity-based clustering technique, are used to identify publication clusters in the two networks. Results show that a few research topics such as webometrics, bibliometric laws, and language processing, form their own research community; while other research topics contain different research communities, which may be caused by physical distance.
