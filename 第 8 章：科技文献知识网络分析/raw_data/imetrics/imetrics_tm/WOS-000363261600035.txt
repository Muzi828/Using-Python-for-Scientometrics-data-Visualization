Ranking research productivity of institutions periodically is of a great necessity nowadays, for that can not only help understand the latest development level of related fields but also contribute to finding gaps and quickly improve. In previous studies, the number of publications and further impact factors of journals is two widely used indexes to measure research productivity. However, impact factors do not always tally with a quality of the journal, which will lead to a bias of research productivity. Given this, a new journal rating adjusted publications (JRAP) index is constructed in this paper, which is based on the journal rating of the ABS journal guide. It takes the quantity of publications and the quality of the publications into account at the same time. Compared with impact factors, academic journal guide can provide more authoritative and accurate measurement to the quality of journals. Experiments are conducted to rank Asia-Pacific institutions in business and management area based on JRAP, and it is the first time to rank Asia-Pacific institutions systematically. Ranking of institutions measured by three methods is also given. Compared the results obtained by three different rank methods, although institutions ranked in the top places keep the same, the specific rank differs. The results indicate that JRAP do prefer the institutions perform well in paper quantity and quality of journals.
