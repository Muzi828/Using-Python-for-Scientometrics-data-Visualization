We present a model to assess the systemness of an innovation system. Patent and citation data with an institutional address in Catalonia (1986-1996) were analyzed in terms of relational linkages and the development in these distributions over time was evaluated using methods from systems dynamics. Relational linkages are extremely scarce. A transition at the system's level could be indicated around 1990 when using institutional addresses, but not when using cognitive categories. The institutional restructuring has led to changes in the pattern of linkages (coauthorship. etc.), but the reproduction of the system's knowledge base has remained differentiated. We conclude that although a system in several other respects, Catalonia cannot (yet) be considered as a (knowledge-based) innovation system. The existence of a mechanism for the integration could not be indicated at the regional level.
