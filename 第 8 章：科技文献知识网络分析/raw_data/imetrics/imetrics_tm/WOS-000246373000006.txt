The capacity to attract citations from other disciplines - or knowledge export - has always been taken into account in evaluating the quality of scientific papers or journals. Some of the JCR's (ISI's Journal Citation Report) Subject Categories have a greater exporting character than others because they are less isolated. This influences the rank/JIF (ISI's Journal Impact Factor) distribution of the category. While all the categories fit a negative power law fairly well, those with a greater External JIF give distributions with a more sharply defined peak and a longer tail - something like an iceberg. One also observes a major relationship between the rates of export and import of knowledge.
