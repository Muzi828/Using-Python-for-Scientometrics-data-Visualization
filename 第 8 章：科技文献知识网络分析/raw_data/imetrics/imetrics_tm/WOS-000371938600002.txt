We propose a new index to quantify SSRN downloads. Unlike the SSRN downloads rank, which is based on the total number of an author's SSRN downloads, our index also reflects the author's productivity by taking into account the download numbers for the papers. Our index is inspired by - but is not the same as - Hirsch's h-index for citations, which cannot be directly applied to SSRN downloads. We analyze data for about 30,000 authors and 367,000 papers. We find a simple empirical formula for the SSRN author rank via a Gaussian function of the log of the number of downloads. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
