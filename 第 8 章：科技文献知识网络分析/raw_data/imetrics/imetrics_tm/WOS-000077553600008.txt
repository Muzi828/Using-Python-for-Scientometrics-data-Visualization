The paper points out that the characteristic properties of general social networks are reflected in co-authorship patterns of theoretical population genetics as studied from 1900 to 1980. The results are consistent with the analyses of bibliographies where the co-authorship networks in invisible colleges probably have shown the same behavioural patterns as the non-scientific populations. The patterns of behaviour are portrayed in two-dimensional as well as three-dimensional representations of co-authorship data in theoretical population genetics.
