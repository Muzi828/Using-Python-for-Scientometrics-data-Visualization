Clustering is applied to web co-outlink analysis to represent the heterogeneous nature of the World Wide Web in terms of the "triple helix" model (university-industry-government). An initial categorization is based on families of websites, which is then matched with Spanish institutions from diverse sectors represented on the Web, to uncover cognitive structures and related subgroups with common interests and confirm the junction of sectors of the "triple helix" model. We may conclude that the clustering method applied to web co-outlink analysis works when fully institutionalized organizations are studied, to make their interconnections manifest.
