An approach to the dynamic optimization of the age structure of scientific personnel in an organization is presented. The appropriate mathematical model describing the age rotation of scientific workers is formulated and the criterion for maximizing the integral productivity of available scientific personnel over given time horizon is introduced. The criterion is constructed by using such scientometric instrument as the ''curves of age productivity''. The practical application of suggested approach is demonstrated by means of real example.
