A top journal is defined as a journal which is within the first 10% of journals ranked by impact factor in the SCI list, within a particular scientific subfield, for the year considered. Journals which were for 11 or more years within the first 10% were considered top journals during the whole period even though they were not within the first 10%, in some of the years covered by this study.
