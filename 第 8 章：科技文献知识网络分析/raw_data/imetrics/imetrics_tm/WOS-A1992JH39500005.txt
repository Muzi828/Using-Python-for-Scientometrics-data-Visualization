This paper examines the applicability of Lotka's formulation as a general inverse power (alpha not-equal 2) and as an inverse square power relationship (alpha = 2) to the distribution of the scientific output in Venezuela. The analysis takes into consideration the sex of the authors and the type of journal, mainstream or national, in which they publish their articles. The data were taken from the last census of scientist. and technologists carried out in 1983 by the Venezuelan government. A K-S and a t-test were applied to measure the degree of agreement between the distribution of the observed set of data against the inverse general power relationship (the former test) and the theoretical value of alpha = 2 (the latter). It was found that a general inverse power relationship only describes the productivity pattern of those Venezuelan women scientists who publish in foreign journals. An inverse square power relationship characterizes the distribution pattern for the data set of female authors in all journals and for scientists of both sexes whose contributions appeared in national journals. The values of alpha suggest that women am less productive than men except in national journals, and Lotka's formulation seems to be useful as an indicator of inequality in male/female scientific productivity.
