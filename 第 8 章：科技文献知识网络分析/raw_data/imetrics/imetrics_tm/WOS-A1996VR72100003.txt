wAlthough co-citation techniques are very powerful structuring tools, the use of science policy indicators based on co-citation has often been criticized, especially on ISI research fronts. A major issue is the small fraction of literature retrieved, i.e. the ''recall rate'' problem. Our investigations indicate that at the level of micro/meso studies high recall rates can be achieved by (a) the use of appropriate clustering techniques limiting singletons and (b) the enrichment of cocited cores by medium-cited items. This combination of appropriate clustering and extension of recall proves to be efficient, provided that careful trade-offs are sought between the extension and relevance of recall. It leads to a reassessment of the performance of the co-citation approach for structuring scientific fields and providing related indicators not limited to the 'leading edge'. It also opens new opportunities for comparison/combination with other relational methods such as co-word analysis.
