The present paper tries to compare international flows of knowledge as measured in meetings with flows as measured with papers in order to see what meetings can add to bibliometric studies. It is shown that most of known bibliometric results are confirmed with meetings, although more skewly: the concentration of proceedings, the dominance and attraction of the United States, and the decline of United Kingdom. However, important limitations are associated with ISTP, namely the low rate of authors' addresses, a Limitation which reduces the interest of ISTP for bibliometric studies.
