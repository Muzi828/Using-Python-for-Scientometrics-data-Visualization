This research examined college students' image searching processes on the Web. The study's objective was to collect empirical data on students' search needs and identify what contextual factors had a significant influence on their image searching tactics. While confirming common search behaviors such as Google-dominant use, short queries, rare use of advanced search options, and checking few search result pages, the findings also revealed a significantly different effect of contextual factors on the tactics of querying and navigating, performance, and relevance judgment. In particular, interaction activities were differentiated by task goals, level of searching expertise, and work task stages. The results suggested that context-sensitive services and interface features would better suit Web users' actual needs and enhance their searching experience.
