As the framework of scientific research, subject-classification plays an important role in the development of science. In order to combine the development of science with the current expert subject-classification system and further give a more appropriate description of scientific output analysis from subject level, We study the relationship between the natural science related sub-categories of Chinese library classification using objective computerized scientometrics, and give some modification to the first two level subjects of the existing Chinese library classification system. Taking Chinese Science Citation Database as our data source, this article studies the similarity of subjects based on journal coupling strength. Then we try to set up an improved subject-classification system whose top categories are relied on Chinese library classification system and sub-categories are the ensemble clustering result based on journal coupling measure. Further, in order to help identifying and interpreting the rationality of this improved classification system, we make use of some text mining methods, such as key words recognition and topic detection, to explain the cause of similarity between some subjects from the perspective of semantic. Our study shows that the improved subject-classification system constructed in this article not only conforms to previous experience and cognitive but also combines subject development knowledge.
