In this work the well known scientometric concepts of bibliographically coupled publications and co-cited references were applied to produce interactive maps of research fronts and knowledge bases of research fields. This article proposes a method and some standardization for the detection and visualization of research fronts and knowledge bases with two and three dimensional graphics inspired by geographical maps. Agglomerations of bibliographically coupled publications with a common knowledge base are identified and graphically represented by a density function of publications per area unit. The research fronts become visible if publications with similar vectors of common citations are associated and visualized as an ensemble in a three dimensional graphical representation as a mountain scenery measured with the help of a spatial density. Knowledge bases were calculated in the same way. Maps similar to the geographic representation of oceans and islands are used to visualize the two-dimensional spatial density function of references weighted by individual links. The proposed methodology is demonstrated by publications in the field of battery research.
