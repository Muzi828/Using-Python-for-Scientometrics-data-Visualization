The country-wise distribution of papers, which cite certain scientist is a sum of typical distribution for his/her branch of science and excessive citations from one or from a few countries. A new Hirsch-type index h_int is defined as the number of countries, h_int, from which at least h_int papers cite certain scientist, but from the country ranked h_int+1 in citing the scientist, less than h_int+1 papers cite that scientist. The h_int index reflects broad international recognition of a scientist, and prevents overrating of a citation record earned chiefly by self-citations or by citations received from a narrow circle of co-workers.
