The trend toward collectivization in Astronomy during this century (1901-1996), as measured by the increase in the number of authors per paper, is analyzed. For this purpose, two leading astronomical journals: The Astrophysical Journal and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society are surveyed. It is found that the average number of authors per paper has jumped from a little more than one in the first half of this century to about three at present. Most of this dramatic increase has taken place during the last 20-25 years. At the same time, the ratio of collective papers (three or more authors) to single-authored ones has passed from nearly zero to 3-4 at present. The latter means that collective papers were almost nonexistent until the fifties or sixties to become nowadays 3-4 times more frequent than single-authored ones. The reasons underlying the collectivization of Astronomy (and perhaps of all natural sciences) are analyzed. The growing professionalization of science accompanied jy a massive influx of graduate students into University research institutes, the revolution in communication, the pressure to publish in order to progress in a scientific career, and the growing complexity of knowledge are invoked as causes for the abandonment of the traditional individualism in science to a collective regime.
