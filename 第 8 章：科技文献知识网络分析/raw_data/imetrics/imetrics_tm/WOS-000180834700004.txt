The goal of this study was to discover the feasibility of adding haptic and auditory displays to traditional visual geographic information systems (GIS). The experiment was conducted with 51 participants to explore the difference in user performance (task completion time and accuracy) and user satisfaction with a multimodal GIS system, which was implemented with a haptic display, auditory display, and combined display. The experiment consisted of a series of 36 tasks in which the participants were asked to identify the highest or the middle valued state among nine U.S. states on maps. The results showed that haptic displays produce faster and more accurate performance than auditory displays and combined displays for more complex tasks. In terms of user satisfaction, the participants preferred the combined display even though they performed best with the haptic display.
