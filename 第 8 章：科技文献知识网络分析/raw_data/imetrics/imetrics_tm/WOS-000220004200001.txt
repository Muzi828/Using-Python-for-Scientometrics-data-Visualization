In a recent paper the authors have studied the role of author self-citations within the process of documented scientific communication. Two important regularities such as the relative fast ageing of self-citations with respect to foreign citations and the "square-root law" characterising the conditional expectation of self-citations for given number of foreign citation have been found studying the phenomenon of author self-citations at the macro level. The goal of the present paper is to study the effect of author self-citations on macro indicators. The analysis of citation based indicators for 15 fields in the sciences, social sciences and humanities substantiates that at this level of aggregation there is no need for any revision of national indicators and the underlying journal citation measures in the context of excluding self-citations.
