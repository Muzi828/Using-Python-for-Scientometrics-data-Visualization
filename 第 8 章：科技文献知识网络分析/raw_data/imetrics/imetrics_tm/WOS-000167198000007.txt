This study investigates end-users' image queries by comparing the features of the queries to those identified in previous studies by Enser and McGregor (1992), Jorgensen (1995), and Fidel (1997), Twenty-nine college students majoring in art history were recruited. They were required to finish a term paper including at least 20 images, The participants' image queries were collected by pre- and postsearch questionnaires, and three human reviewers mapped these queries into the previously identified features. Enser and McGregor's categories of Unique and Nonunique, and Jorgensen's classes of Location, Literal Object, Art Historical Information, People, and People-Related Attributes received high degrees of matching by three reviewers, This finding can be applied to add more details to Enser and McGregor's four categories (Unique, Nonunique, Unique with refiners, and Nonunique with refiners) and to regroup Jorgensen's 12 classes of image attributes.
