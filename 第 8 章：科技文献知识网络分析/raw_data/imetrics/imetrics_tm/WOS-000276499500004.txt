The purpose of the research was to establish and inform about the features of productivity across all scholarly fields measured through journals indexed in WoS in which Croatian authors working in Croatian institutions published since independence (1991) to 2005. Total 19,929 papers in 2,946 journals were found. Of these, 17,875 papers were published in 2,690 science, technology and medicine (STM) journals, 1,869 papers were published in 178 social science journals, and 185 were published in 78 A&H journals according to custom classification used in the research. Special attention was given to publishing features of specific scholarly fields. The number of different journals in which the papers were published per year has doubled in the period (from 404 in 1991 to 894 in 2005). To support additional insight, a distinction between national and international journals was made and top 10% journals according to JCR 2005 categories were identified by IF. National journals accounted for 15.9% of STM papers, 77.6% of social science papers and 25.9% of A&H papers. Top 10% journals accounted for a total of 368 journals and 2,336 papers with significant variations across the subfields.
