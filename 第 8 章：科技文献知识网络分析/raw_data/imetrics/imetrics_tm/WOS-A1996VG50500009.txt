The R&D laboratory organization attempts to shape and is influenced by complex and changing environments. New contexts affect the types of evaluation required. Traditional approaches to the R&D laboratory evaluation are thus to be questioned. The changing competitive contexts of R&D organization suggest four worlds of innovation: (i) technology races, (ii) efficiency in technological systems, (iii) technical parity and (iv) marker contests. In the emerging competitive arena, the R&D laboratory is evolving toward a network type of organization linked to many different partners and acting as a semi-autonomous business unit. New roles are expected from these kinds of laboratories. They have to develop core strategic competencies, offer competitive outputs, meet clients specifications, create new technology standards and maintain or increase their leadership positions. Bibliometric analysis need to be used in complement with many other methods.
