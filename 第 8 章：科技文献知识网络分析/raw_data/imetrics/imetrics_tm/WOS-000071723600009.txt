Many new journals are started in response to increasing specialization and limited space in existing journals. In this study two journals in organization research are studied, Administrative Science Quarterly as the first mover in the field and Organization Studies as the challenger. It is shown that the new journal gradually differ from the old in terms of the national origin of its authors as well as the documents cited. It is concluded that the scientific journal market may not mirror the copy-cat behaviour found among newspapers or companies in other markets.
