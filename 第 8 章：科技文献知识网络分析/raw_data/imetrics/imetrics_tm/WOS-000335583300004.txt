The Gene Ontology (GO), a scientific vocabulary widely used in molecular biology databases, is examined by an analysis of its structure, a comparison of its principles to those of traditional controlled vocabularies, and by a detailed analysis of a single concept within it. It is found that the GO deviates in some respects from its principles of ontological realism, and it is suggested the two forms of vocabulary could benefit from adopting good practice from the other.
