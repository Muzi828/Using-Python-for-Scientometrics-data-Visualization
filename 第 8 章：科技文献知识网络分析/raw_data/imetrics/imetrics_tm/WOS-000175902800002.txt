We describe the steps involved in constructing authors' citation identities (whom they cite) and citation images (who cites them). Familiarity with the intellectual, social, and institutional connections of these authors over time helps inform the analysis and augment the specificity of citation counts. Our study shows that authors' writing and referencing styles constitute a form of watermark for their scholarly output.
