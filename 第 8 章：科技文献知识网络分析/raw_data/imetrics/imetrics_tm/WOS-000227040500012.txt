The year 2002 brought a successive funding change-over from until now institutional to programme oriented funding (POF) in the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres (HGF). This way the 15 German research centres now have to generate their means successively from programmes of the research fields of the HGF (see: www.helmholtz.de) by competing with each other. This nucleus of the reform of the Association is being implemented based upon the opinion of international experts. In this context the evaluation of publications of individual research centres, resp. research groups will be playing an ever increasing part. This lecture will inform about the reformed, partially formalized system and first experiences therewith at the time of the first evaluations.
