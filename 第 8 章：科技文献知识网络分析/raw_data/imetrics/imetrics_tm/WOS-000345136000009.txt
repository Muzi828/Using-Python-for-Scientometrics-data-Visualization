Measuring scientific performance is currently a common practice of funding agencies, fellowship evaluations and hiring institutions. However, as has already been recognized by many authors, comparing the performance in different scientific fields is a difficult task due to the different publication and citation patterns observed in each field. In this article, we defend that scientific performance of an individual scientist, laboratory or institution should be analysed within the corresponding context and we provide objective tools to perform this kind of comparative analysis. The usage of the new tools is illustrated by using two control groups, to which several performance measurements are referred: one group being the Physics and Chemistry Nobel laureates from 2007 to 2012, the other group consisting of a list of outstanding scientists affiliated to two different institutions.
