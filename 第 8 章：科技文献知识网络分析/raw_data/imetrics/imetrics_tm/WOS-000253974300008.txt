Statistical distributions in the production of information are most often studied in the framework of Lotkaian informetrics. In this paper, we recall some results of basic theory of Lotkaian informetrics, then we transpose methods (Theorem 1) applied to Lotkaian distributions by Leo Egghe (Theorem 2) to the exponential distributions (Theorem 3, Theorem 4). We give examples and compare the results (Theorem 5). Finally, we propose to widen the problem using the concept of exponential informetric process (Theorem 6). (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
