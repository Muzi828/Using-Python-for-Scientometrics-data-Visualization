An effective bibliometric analysis was applied in this work to evaluate global scientific production of the subject category of "limnology" from 2001 to 2010. Data was based on the Science Citation Index compiled by Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), Philadelphia, USA. The h-index and NetDraw were designed to characterize the limnology publications. The results showed that the limnology research constantly increased over the past decade. The researchers paid most attention to "diatoms", "eutrophication" and "phosphorus". Moreover, the keywords plus of "growth", "model", "dynamic", offered a thorough description for the limnology research. Among the research institutes interested in limnologic research, the US Geological Survey was the flagship while the USA attained a dominant position in the global research in the field.
