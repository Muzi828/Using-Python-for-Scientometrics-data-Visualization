Swedish publication-based biomedical doctoral dissertations examined since 1992 were compared with a sample from 1968-92. Theses in either group had an average of four published papers and one submitted manuscript. The average number of authors per paper was four in the 1992+ sample, an increase of one author on the 1968-92. The candidate was first or sole author on 77% of papers indicating that the same paper is not used for several theses. It is proposed that three papers should form the basis of a common European PhD if this is to be completed, including examined, within three years, and four papers if four years.
