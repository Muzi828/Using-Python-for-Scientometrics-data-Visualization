Internet has made it possible to move towards researcher and article impact instead of solely focusing on journal impact. To support citation measurement, several indexes have been proposed, including the h-index. The h-index provides a point estimate. To address this, a new index is proposed that takes the citation curve of a researcher into account. This article introduces the index, illustrates its use and compares it to rankings based on the h-index as well as rankings based on publications. It is concluded that the new index provides an added value, since it balances citations and publications through the citation curve.
