Methodological implications of four accounting procedures applied in multiple authorship treatment relating to author productivity distribution were investigated.  The emphasis was given to the individual author rank and inequality pattern of data.  It was found that similar pattern of inequality holds in three of the four analysed cases, in spite of the fact that significant changes were observed on the individual level.  By introducing the concept of dual approach a plausible interpretation of that phenomenon was obtained.
