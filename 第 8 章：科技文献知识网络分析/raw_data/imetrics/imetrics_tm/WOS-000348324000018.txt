The aim of this paper is to determine the role that academic collaboration plays on the impact of Latin-American and the Caribbean research on management as an academic research discipline. The results show that the impact of Latin American articles on management, which were published between 1990 and 2010 in JCR journals is positively associated to collaboration r (s) = .133, p = .001. Collaborated articles have on average 1.22 times more impact than single authored ones. The level of collaboration is positively correlated to impact r (s) = .337, p = .001. Articles published through international collaboration have 1.59 times more impact than those published through domestic collaboration.
