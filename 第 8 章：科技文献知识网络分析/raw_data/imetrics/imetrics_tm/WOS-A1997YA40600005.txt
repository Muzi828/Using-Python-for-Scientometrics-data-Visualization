This paper attempts to monitor the changes in research priorities in Physics by analyzing the research profile of thirty three countries in major fields of Physics as classified under PACS (Physics and Astronomy Classification scheme). Data is taken from INSPEC (CD-ROM) version under two different time periods - 1990 & 1995. Priority Index (PI) is used to understand the priorities of countries in major fields and shifts in their priorities during these two time periods. Correspondence analysis is applied to the matrices of research priorities to understand the multivariate relationships between countries and fields and reveal the dynamics of changes taking place in two time periods. The results and its implications For policy studies are discussed.
