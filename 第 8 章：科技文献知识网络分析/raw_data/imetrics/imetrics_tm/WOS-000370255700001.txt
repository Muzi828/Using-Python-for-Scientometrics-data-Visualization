Disclosure of personal information on social networks has been extensively researched in recent years from different perspectives, including the influence of demographic, personality, and social parameters on the extent and type of disclosure. However, although some of the most widespread uses of these networks nowadays are for professional, academic, and business purposes, a thorough investigation of professional information disclosure is still needed. This study's primary aim, therefore, is to conduct a systematic and comprehensive investigation into patterns of professional information disclosure and various factors involved on different types of social networks. To this end, a user survey was conducted. We focused specifically on Facebook and LinkedIn, the 2 diverse networks most widely used in Israel. Significant differences were found between these networks. For example, we found that on Facebook professional pride is a factor in professional information disclosure, whereas on LinkedIn, work seniority and income have a significant effect. Thus, our findings shed light on the attitudes and professional behavior of network members, leading to recommendations regarding advertising strategies and network-appropriate self-presentation, as well as approaches that companies might adopt according to the type of manpower required.
