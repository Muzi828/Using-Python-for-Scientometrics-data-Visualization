In a questionnaire study Swedish university scientists in different research areas were asked about their conceptions of scientific quality.  The items concerned relationships between quality and the research effort, the researcher, the research environment, research effects, research policy and organization, research financing and research evaluation. 224 persons (56% of the sample) answered. Results showed that researchers shared views on scientific quality, but there were also a number of differences between soft and hard sciences.  It is concluded that the differences largely support the distinction between ''human'' and natural sciences, as well as the one between pre-paradigmatic and paradigmatic sciences. Implications for the evaluation of research are discussed
