Distributing scientific funding to the suitable universities and research fields is very important to the innovation acceleration in science and technology. Using a longitudinal panel dataset of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), the total 224,087 sponsored projects is utilized to investigate the distributions of scientific funding across universities and research disciplines. The inequality of funding distribution is studied through the investigation of Gini coefficient, and its fundamental rules are discovered through the technique of distribution fitting. It is found that the inequality of distributions of NSFC funding across 1971 universities is decreasing, and the distribution of funding and supported universities of 971 research fields follow Generalized Pareto distribution and Geometric distribution function, respectively. This study is dedicated to give an entire landscape to help make policy of distributing scientific funding. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
