The study of international technology spillover focuses on bilateral relationship between host country and home country, and the study of transnational technology network focuses on the position and power of individual country in a network. Introducing the network model and information theory into the research framework, we propose a new measure of international technology spillover in this present article, in which the bilateral relationship was transformed to multilateral relationship between countries, and network features at the whole network level were investigated instead of at the individual level. By using data from CHELEM-International Trade Database, we measure three transnational spillover networks in the high-tech field from 1979 to 2009, and analyze the results of various technology networks at different time points.
