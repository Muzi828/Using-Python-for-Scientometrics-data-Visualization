Empirical research carried out on a representative sample of 921 scientists from Croatia has shown that scientific fields are important socio-cognitive productivity framework. First, this can be seen in significantly different patterns of the average scientific productivity of researchers in different fields. Second, significant are the differences in the social organization of scientific fields, especially in the fragmentation and organization of the research process, which manifest themselves with a different engagement intensity of the respondents in each stage of the project. Finally, scientific productivity predictors are structured, ranging from significant ones in some fields, to those significant everywhere (qualifications and project roles).
