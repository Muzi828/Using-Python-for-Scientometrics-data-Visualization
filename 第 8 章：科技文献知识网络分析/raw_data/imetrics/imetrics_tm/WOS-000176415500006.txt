Publications originating from Turkey in SSCI were analyzed for changes in the thirty-year span between 1970 and 1999. There has been a high rate of increase in the number of publications and most of these publications were in the form of articles and review papers. The rate of increase was lower than the increase in science publications but the rankings among other countries in sciences and social sciences were comparable. The analysis of impact factors and citations received by published work showed a decline across years. Many of the high-impact publications were joint work with foreign authors. The low level of impact was attributed in part by the difficulty of international scholars in belonging to research networks.
