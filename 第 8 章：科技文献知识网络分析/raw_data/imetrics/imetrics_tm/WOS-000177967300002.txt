Explores the Malaysian computer science and information technology publication productivity. A total of 547 unique Malaysian authors, affiliated to 52 organizations in Malaysia, contributed 461 publications between 1990 and 1999 as indicated by data collected from three Web-based databases. The majority (378 or 69.1%) of authors wrote one publication. The productive authors and the number of their papers as well as the position of their names in the articles are listed to indicate their productivity and degree of involvement in their research publications. Researchers from the universities contribute about 428 (92.8%) publications. The three most productive institutions together account for a total of 258 (56.0%) publications. The composition of the publications are 197 (42.7%) journal articles, 263 (57.1%) conference papers, and 1 (0.2%) monograph chapters. The results indicate that the scholars published in a few core proceedings but contributed to a wide variety of journals. Thirty-nine fields of research undertaken by the scholars are also revealed. The possible reasons for the amount and pattern of contributions are related to the size of researcher population in the country, the availability of refereed scholarly journals, and the total expenditure allocated to information, computers, and communication technology (ICCT) research in Malaysia.
