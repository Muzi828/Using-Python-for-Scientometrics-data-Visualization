This paper presents an analysis of the structure of computer science research articles published in the Lecture Notes of Computer Science series. While it is clear that most articles start with an Introduction and end with a Conclusion, the structure of text between these two sections is rather diverse. We studied the positions of different section types, and analysed dependencies between them. As a result, we present a number of common patterns used by writers, and make suggestions on how to improve the presentation of research in computer science.
