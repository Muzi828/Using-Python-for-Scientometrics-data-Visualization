We present the distribution of astronomical papers published by Chinese authors in 1986-1990 across the various subfields of astronomy, the total number of papers produced by each observatory or university during the five years, and the ranking of the observatories by productivity. Our main data base includes 24 journals: 9 foreign ones published in English, 10 Chinese national ones, and 5 Chinese observatory publications. About 70 journals published by Chinese universities have also been consulted. This data base covers up to 90% of all astronomical papers published during this period.
