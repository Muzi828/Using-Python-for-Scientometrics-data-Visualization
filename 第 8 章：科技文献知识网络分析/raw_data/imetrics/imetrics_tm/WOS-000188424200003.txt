In this paper we introduce two measures self-linked and self-linking that are the analogues of self-citing and self-cited rates for scientific journals. These rates are calculated for a sample of sites to assess their meaning and utility. Self-linked is the more meaningful measure for the sample sites. As a first step towards a better understanding of self-linking (linking within a site), a sample of pages from an academic site was characterized using the method of content analysis. Even though most of the links serve navigational or other technical purposes, the percentage of content-bearing links among the self-links is significant, and even the portion of research oriented links is non-negligible.
