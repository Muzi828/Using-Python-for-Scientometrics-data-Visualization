We propose a method for selecting the research guarantor when papers are co-authored. The method is simply based on identifying the corresponding author. The method is here applied to global scientific output based on the SCOPUS database in order to build a new output distribution by country. This new distribution is then compared with previous output distributions by country but which were based on whole or fractional counting, not only for the total output but also for the excellence output (papers belonging to the 10 % most cited papers). The comparison allows one to examine the effect of the different methodological approaches on the scientific performance indicators assigned to countries. In some cases, there was a very large variation in scientific performance between the total output (whole counting) and output as research guarantor. The research guarantor approach is especially interesting when used with the excellence output where the quantity of excellent papers is also a quality indicator. The impact of excellent papers naturally has less variability as they are all top-cited papers.
