Results are presented of an analysis of 1333 papers in the SCI from 1986-1993 supported by the BAP, with their degree of tans-nationality, level of dependence on the programme and propensity to acknowledge this, and their record of citation by authors in different groups of countries.  The papers are nearly three times as transnational in their addresses as other EC biotechnology papers, but nearly 25% of single country papers depend on foreign co-authors or acknowledge transnational support.  BAP was acknowledged by 80% of the papers that received 20% or more support.  Citations by authors from other EC Member States account for many of the extra citations received by BAP papers and show that the results of the programme have been effectively disseminated by the Commission within the EC.
