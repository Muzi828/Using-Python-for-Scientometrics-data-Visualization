This article presents a genetic relevance optimization process performed in an information retrieval system. The process uses genetic techniques for solving multi-modal problems (niching) and query reformulation techniques commonly used in information retrieval. The niching technique allows the process to reach different relevance regions of the document space. Query reformulation techniques represent domain knowledge integrated in the genetic operators structure to improve the convergence conditions of the algorithm. Experimental analysis performed using a TREC subcollection validates our approach.
