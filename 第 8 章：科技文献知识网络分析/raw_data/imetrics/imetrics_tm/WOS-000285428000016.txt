Among existing theoretical models for the h-index, Hirsch's original approach, the Egghe-Rousseau model, and the Glanzel-Schubert model are the three main representatives. Assuming a power-law relation or Heaps' law between publications and citations a unified theoretical explanation for these three models is provided. It is shown that on the level of universities, the Glanzel-Schubert model fits best.
