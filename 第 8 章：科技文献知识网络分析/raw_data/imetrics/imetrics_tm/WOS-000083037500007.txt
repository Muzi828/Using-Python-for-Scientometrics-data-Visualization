Interview data from a survey among Danish researchers, mainly from social sciences (all disciplines, about on third of all) are used to examine connections between researcher political attitudes and their disciplinary cognitive paradigms. Included are researchers' convictions concerning world view hypotheses, their basic assumptions regarding the subject matter in their fields of study, e.g., individuals, social action, and society as a whole, and their epistemic ideals and goals. Political attitude is indicated by researchers' voting in the 1994 general election of the Danish Parliament.
The results show big differences between social science disciplines regarding voting pattern. The analysis also clearly demonstrates connections between disciplinary cognitive convictions and political attitudes. The connections are interpreted as expressions of hermeneutic, historical links between political discourse formations and disciplinary paradigms.
