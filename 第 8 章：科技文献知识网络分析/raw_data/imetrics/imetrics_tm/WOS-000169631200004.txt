In this paper we examine the validity of Lotka's law and Zipf's law for research output in 15 top journals of economics in the period 1977 to 1997. Our data for individual authors satisfy a general form of Lotka's law. We find increasing competition over time among economists on the individual level. However, publications in top journals are concentrated heavily when the institutional level is under consideration. Research output of institutions can be fit adequately by Zipf's law.
