This study deals with the uniformity of the collaboration process within the scientist's system by describing all two-dimensional and three-dimensional referential patterns with only one nonlinear function. The variety of these patterns is expressed in dependence upon the conditions or environment that induced them by means of varying the parameters of this non-linear function. Based on their similarity these various patterns can be divided into different types.
