Progress in search interfaces requires vigorous inquiry into how search features can be embedded into application environments such as those for decision-making, personal information collecting, and designing. Progress can be made by focusing on mid-level descriptions of how search components can draw upon and update workspace content and structure. The immediate goal is to advance our understanding of how to shape and exploit context in search. The long-term goal is to develop an interdisciplinary design resource that enables stakeholders in the computing, social, and information sciences to more richly impact each others'work.
