This paper investigates how the use of different statistical methods and study design characteristics affected the number of citations in psychiatric journals. Original research articles (N=448) from four psychiatric journals were reviewed. Aspects measured included the use of statistical methodology, presentation of results, description of procedures, country of the corresponding author and number of the authors. The use of statistical methods was not strongly associated with the further utilisation of an article. The effect was low compared to the impact of correspondence address or number of authors. Extended description of statistical procedures and an experimental study design had a positive effect to the received citations.
