Using Luhmann's communication framework, we examine the interaction implications for kindergarten to Grade 2 students using mathematics applications on four types of tablet computers. Research questions included what content is communicated between the child and the tablet computer and how engaged are children in the interaction. We found that mathematics applications developers have focused on creating applications for the practice of a priori knowledge, rather than on creating instructional applications. Results show preliminary evidence that child-tablet communication is generally successful, but this success comes at the cost of richer, multimodal interactions. Tablet computer application developers are being cautious in offering a variety of options for children to interact with the devices, and we suggest that there is scope for a broadening of communicative interaction modes.
