To be able to measure the scientific output of researchers is an increasingly important task to support research assessment decisions. To do so, we can find several different measures and indices in the literature. Recently, the h-index, introduced by Hirsch in 2005, has got a lot of attention from the scientific community for its good properties to measure the scientific production of researchers. Additionally, several different indicators, for example, the g-index, have been developed to try to improve the possible drawbacks of the h-index. In this paper we present a new index, called hg-index, to characterize the scientific output of researchers which is based on both h-index and g-index to try to keep the advantages of both measures as well as to minimize their disadvantages.
