Underutilization of Web-based subscription databases and the importance of promoting them have been recognized in previous research. To determine the factors affecting user acceptance of Web-based subscription databases, this study tests an integrated model of the antecedents and consequences of user beliefs about intended use by extending the technology acceptance model. The research employs a cross-sectional field study using a Web survey method targeting undergraduate students who have experience with Web-based subscription databases. Overall, the research model performs well in explaining user acceptance of Web-based subscription databases. The effects of the cognitive instrumental determinants of usefulness perceptions are examined. Terminology clarity and accessibility were found to be important determinants for ease of use of the databases. The results indicate that user training has no impact on either perceptions of usefulness or ease of use, and that there is a need to reexamine the effectiveness of user training in the context of Web-based subscription databases. The results suggest that user acceptance of the databases depends largely on the utility they offer. The findings also suggest that although a subjective norm does not directly affect intended use, it exerts a positive influence on user beliefs about the utility of the databases.
