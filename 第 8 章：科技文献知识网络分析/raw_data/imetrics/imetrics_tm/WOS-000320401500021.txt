This study attempts to examine systematically the growth trajectories of science, technology and science-based technologies of Japan and South Korea. Drawing upon the empirical materials and findings, this paper provides a detailed description of the evolution and pathways taken by Japan and South Korea to achieve growth in science and technology. Both the quantities (number of papers and patents) and impact (citations) measures of research activities are used to provide a coherent depiction of progress and development trajectories. Japan and South Korea achieved significant progress in production of science and technology. However, both economies experienced a sharp contraction in the number of citations per new patent since the mid 2000s. To address their structural systemic failure, Japan and South Korea have invested heavily in scientific areas that concord with the next wave of technological innovations. The effort has recorded positive effects on science-based technological growth trajectories.
