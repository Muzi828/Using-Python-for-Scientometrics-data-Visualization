I read the article of Glanzel and Schoepflin: Little Scientometrics, Big Scientometrics ... and Beyond. This paper presents scientometrics in a very pessimistic way, but, in my opinion it rises the following question: in which business are we?
Are we in the analysis of the science production? Do we develop new tools to analyse the textual information?
And, above all we use our results and for which purposes.
It seems to me that if we answer those questions, a large step will be made in the understanding of the whereabout of our business.
