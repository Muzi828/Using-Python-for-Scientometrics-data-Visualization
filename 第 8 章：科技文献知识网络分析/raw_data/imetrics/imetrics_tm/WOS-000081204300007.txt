The paper examines the scientific productivity of male and female scientists working in the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India at the overall agency level and at the group of laboratories level, characterized by three broad subjects of physical, biological, and engineering sciences. The productivity of scientists is evaluated on the basis of three parameters: the extent of scientists not publishing any paper, the average number of papers per scientist, and using Lotka's approach. In order to find out whether there is any significant difference between male and female productivity distributions, a Chi-square test is used. Studies the applicability of Lotka's inverse power law and some other statistical models in the distribution of scientific productivity of male and female scientists. Concludes that no significant difference exists between productivity distributions of male and female scientists.
