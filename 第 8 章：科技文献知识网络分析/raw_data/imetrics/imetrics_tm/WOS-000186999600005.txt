The scientific production measured by the number of mainstream joint publications, resulting from the cooperative research efforts between Chile and Spain, considering disciplines, application field, type of journal, impact factor, and research institutions involved, was analyzed for the 1991 2000 period. Databases from several institutions, such as the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) in USA and other national organizations, were employed to quantify the number of publications and to determine the profile of the mutual-collaboration research groups of both countries. It was possible to establish the strong points of the mutual work in some disciplines and the formation of a critical mass of researchers, showing that the scientific cooperation between countries of emerging-economies, like Chile, and developed nations, as Spain, is possible and leads to mutual benefits.
