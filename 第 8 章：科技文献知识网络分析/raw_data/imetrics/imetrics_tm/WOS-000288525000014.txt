Developed in the early 1980s-well before Internet and web-based technologies had arrived-Taylor's Value-Added Model introduced what is now better known as the human-actors' needs perspective on information systems/information technology (IS/IT) artifacts. Taylor distinguished six top-level criteria that mattered most to human actors when using IS/IT artifacts. We develop this approach further and present the TEDS framework as an analytical instrument for actor- and utilization-specific evaluation of IS/IT artifacts as well as a practical tool for moderating and formulating design specifications. We use the empirical case of a comprehensive comparative professional sports team web site evaluation project to illustrate the power and versatility of the extended analytical framework.
