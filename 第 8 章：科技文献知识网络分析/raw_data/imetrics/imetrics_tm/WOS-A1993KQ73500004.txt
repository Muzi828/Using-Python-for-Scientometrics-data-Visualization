The paper examines the qualitative as well as quantitative indicators for the assessment of the scientific publication activities of 32 countries, with special attention to the Zipf-Pareto distribution of those indicators. Also discussed is the linear relationship between the number of first authors of scientific papers in a given country and the number of papers it produced. Based on these discussions, a comprehensive indicator combining the merits of quantitative and qualitative indicators is suggested. The ranking of the 32 countries by this indicator is found to follow also Zipf-Pareto distribution.
