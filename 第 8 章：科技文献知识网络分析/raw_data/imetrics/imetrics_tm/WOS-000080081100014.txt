In this paper the identification and analysis of highly dynamic, rapidly developing research fronts of climate research are demonstrated. The underlying method based on co-citation analysis is described, and two selected highly dynamic specialities (HDS) are analysed using journal profiles, co-citation maps, and actor profiles as information elements. The two examples demonstrate how co-citation analysis can be used to identify and analyse highly dynamic specialities.
