The mean normalized citation score or crown indicator is a much studied bibliometric indicator that normalizes citation counts across fields. We examine the theoretical basis of the normalization method and, in particular, the determination of the expected number of citations. We observe a theoretical bias that raises the expected number of citations for low citation fields and lowers the expected number of citations for high citation fields when interdisciplinary publications are included.
