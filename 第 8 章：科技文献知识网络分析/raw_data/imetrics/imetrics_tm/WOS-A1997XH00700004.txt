The study reports an empirical comparison of quality of collaborative research with the quality of individual research. Quality of a paper is measured by the citation rate over the four years following the year of publication. Papers published in fourteen Finance journals between 1987-1991 are sampled. There is no significant difference between the quality of collaborative and individual research. Decision-makers should hesitate in interpreting collaborative research as a definitive sign of ability to produce better research.
