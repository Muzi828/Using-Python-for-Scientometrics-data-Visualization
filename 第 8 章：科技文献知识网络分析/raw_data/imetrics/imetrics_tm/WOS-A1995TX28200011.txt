The Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (MPG) is a nonprofit organization founded in 1948 as a successor to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft, which was originally established in 1911. Institutes run by the MPG are mainly devoted to basic research, to a large extent in the sciences and, to a smaller extent, in the humanities. In contrast to the university system, which must cover all academic disciplines, the MPG can concentrate its funds and its energy on selected key areas of basic research. In all of the decision making processes concerning structural or institutional changes as well as the reallocation of resourses, evaluation has a crucial role to play. The paper outlines the various ways and levels of quality assessment within the Max Planck system. in particular, it emphasizes the Importance of ex ante-evaluation, and the need for an assessment of ongoing research work at regular intervals. Furthermore, the strengths and weaknesses of quantitative indicators are discussed, and, finally, some principles for policy-relevant evaluations formulated.
