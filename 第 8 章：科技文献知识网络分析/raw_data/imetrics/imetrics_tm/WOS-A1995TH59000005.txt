In his article ''Networks of Scientific Papers'', Price argued that the N-rays reference network exhibits characteristics one would expect for a cumulative and rapidly developing research area. Although subsequent researchers have questioned Price's characterization of the N-rays network, there have been no replications of Price's work for either the N-rays literature or for any other literature. We reexamine the N-rays reference network, this time distinguishing negative citations and self citations from other citations. Although previous studies of negative and self citations show they are relatively infrequent in scientific literatures, we find that both are very prominent in the N-rays literature. In addition, we show that self citations comprise most of the ''recency effect'' observed in the N-rays reference network, and that the high level of self citations in the N-rays literature results primarily from the character of the journal that published the majority of the N-rays papers. Our findings therefore support those who have been skeptical about Price's claim that the N-rays reference graph exemplifies basic characteristics of the structure of scientific literatures.
