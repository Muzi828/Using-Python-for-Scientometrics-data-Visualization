This article aims to study the total backlink counts, external backlink counts and the Web Impact Factors (WIFs) for Chinese university websites. By studying whether the backlink counts and WIFs of websites associate with the comprehensive ratings and the research ratings for Chinese universities, the article demonstrates that the external backlink count can be a better evaluation measure for university websites than WIF. The study also investigated issues about data collection by using different search engines. It shows that data collected by Alta Vista are more stable than AllTheWeb.
