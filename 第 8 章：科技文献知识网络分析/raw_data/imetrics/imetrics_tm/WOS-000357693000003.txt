Previous researchers of citation analysis often analyze patent data of a single authority because of the availability of the data and the simplicity of analysis. Patent analysis, on the other hand, is used not only for filing and litigation, but also for technology trend analysis. However, global technology trends cannot be understood only with the analysis of patent data issued by a single authority. In this paper, we propose the use of patents from multiple authorities and discuss the effect of bundling patent family information. We investigate the effect of patent families with cases from automobile drivetrain technology. Based on the results, we conclude that the use of multiple authorities' patent data bundled with the patent family information can significantly improve the coverage and practicability of patent citation analysis.
