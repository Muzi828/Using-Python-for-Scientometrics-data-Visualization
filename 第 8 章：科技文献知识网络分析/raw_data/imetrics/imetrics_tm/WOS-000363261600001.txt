This paper presents a scientometric analysis of research work done on the emerging area of 'Big Data' during the recent years. Research on 'Big Data' started during last few years and within a short span of time has gained tremendous momentum. It is now considered one of the most important emerging areas of research in computational sciences and related disciplines. We have analyzed the research output data on 'Big Data' during 2010-2014 indexed in both, the Web of Knowledge and Scopus. The analysis maps comprehensively the parameters of total output, growth of output, authorship and country-level collaboration patterns, major contributors (countries, institutions and individuals), top publication sources, thematic trends and emerging themes in the field. The paper presents an elaborate and one of its kind scientometric mapping of research on 'Big Data'.
