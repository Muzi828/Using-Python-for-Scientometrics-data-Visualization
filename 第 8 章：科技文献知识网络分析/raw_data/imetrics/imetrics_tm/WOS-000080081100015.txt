A recurring theme in the use of science and technology indicators, as well as in the construction of new ones, is the interpretation of these indicators. Given the dependence on citation data in the majority of interesting science and technology indicators, a general citation theory would make the meaning of S&T indicators more transparent. Hence the continuing call for a citation theory in scientometrics. So far, such a theory has not yet been accepted by the experts in the field. This paper suggests an explanation for this. It also tries to sketch the outline of a general indicator theory by discussing new implications of an earlier proposal (Wouters, 1998) in relation to existing citation and indicator theories.
