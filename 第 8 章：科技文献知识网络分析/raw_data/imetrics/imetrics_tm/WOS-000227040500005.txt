The possible existence of specialisation patterns by research fields of the Italian regions is investigated. Accordingly, bibliometric data on papers published in international scientific journals have been processed and tailored for regional comparative analysis. The results show that the trends in scientific regional specialisation are related to the research activities performed by each scientific system, but also the regional industrial skill is very often reflected in the corresponding scientific profile.
The empirical evidences show also that each Italian region works as a well identifiable scientific system providing for its own specific contribution to the national performance.
