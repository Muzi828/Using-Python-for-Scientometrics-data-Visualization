Composite science and technology (S&T) indices are essential to overall understanding and evaluation of national S&T status, and to formulation of S&T policy. However, only a few studies on making these indices have been conducted so far since a number of complications and uncertainties are involved in the work. Therefore, this study proposes a new approach to employ fuzzy set theory and to make composite S&T indices, and applies it. The approach appears to Successfully integrate various S&T indicators into three indices: R&D input, R&D output, and economic Output. We also compare Korea's S&T indices with those of five developed countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to obtain some implications of the results for Korea's S&T.
