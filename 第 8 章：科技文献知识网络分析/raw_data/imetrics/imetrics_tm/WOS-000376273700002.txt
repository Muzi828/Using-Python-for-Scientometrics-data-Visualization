The aim of this paper is to measure the relevance of the institutions in the academic community involved in creating and disseminating knowledge in the field of Management through their position in the collaboration network. This relevance is defined by an original and more comprehensive approach to the analysis of each institution's importance through degree centrality, as it includes scientific output, while at the same time taking into account the level of collaboration between institutions, as well as the impact of the publications in which each institution is involved. This approach enables us to draw up a ranking of the 103 leading institutions, as well as overcome some of the limitations of prior studies by considering the role each institution plays in the academic community, not only through its scientific output or citations but also through the relationships it forges with other institutions. Our findings confirm the existence of elite groups worldwide that collaborate with other minor institutions, whereas major institutions collaborate less with each other.
