Based on data collected by the authors in Flemish public libraries, we show how the negative binomial distribution (NBD) can be used as a trend distribution for library circulation data. Although actual data show more variation than simple statistics can explain, we recommend the use of the NBD for practical, managerial purposes. As a consequence we also recommend the teaching of these methods in introductory library management courses.
