This study analyzes the pattern of transnational linkages of Indian science in eleven scientific fields (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Earth & Space Science, Agriculture, Clinical Medicine, Biomedical Research, Engineering & Technology, Computer Science, and Materials Science) during the five-year period: 1990-1994. The following indicators are constructed to examine inter-field and inter-country differences in India's transnational linkages: Internationalization index, Cooperation index, Cooperation extensiveness index and Affinity index. A four-category typology is proposed to classify the fields according to their propensities for attracting bilateral and multilateral cooperation with foreign countries.
The structure of multidimensional system of relationships between India's thirty-five most significant partner countries and eleven scientific fields is analyzed through correspondence analysis. A series of correspondence analyses are carried out on subsets of the multidimensional data to reveal the fine-grained structure of India's cooperation links in clusters of specific fields and with clusters of specific countries.
