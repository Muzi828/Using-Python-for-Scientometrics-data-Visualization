It is a well-known empirical fact that when informetric processes are observed over an extending period of time, the entire shape of the distribution changes. In particular, it has been shown that concentration aspects change. In this paper the recently introduced co-concentration coefficient (C-CC) is investigated via simple stochastic models of informetric processes to investigate its time-dependence. It is shown that it is important to distinguish between situations where the zero-producers can be counted and those where they cannot. A previously published data set is used to illustrate how the empirical C-CC develops in time and the general features are compared with those derived from the theoretical model.
