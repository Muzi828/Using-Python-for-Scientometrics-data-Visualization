Analysis over a 13 year period of citation counts to research papers in pursuit of a new scientific hypothesis on the mechanism of action of oestrogen hormones, which therefore could be defined at the micro-level, revealed that during a period of expansion of the field there was an overall fall in mean citation counts, even to papers by with hindsight still successful groups. This fall appeared to be related to a relatively greater increase in the number of papers to be cited than in the number of citing papers.
