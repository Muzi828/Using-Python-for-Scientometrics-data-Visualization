In this article a set of requirements for the design of a personal document management system is presented, based on the results of three research studies (Bondarenko, 2006; Bondarenko & Janssen, 2005; Bondarenko & Janssen, 2009). We propose a framework, based on layers of task decomposition, that helps to understand the needs of information workers with regard to personal document and task management. Relevant user processes are described and requirements for a document-management system are derived for each layer. The derived requirements are compared to related studies, and implications for system design are discussed.
