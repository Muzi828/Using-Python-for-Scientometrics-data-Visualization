The strategy of judging the quality of scientific research by the level of funding it attracts is critically examined.  It is argued that an index such as per capita research income, which is based on grant-giver peer review, yields an unsatisfactory measure of scientific performance.  It fails to fulfil a basic requirement of a performance indicator, namely, that it should relate outputs to inputs.  It has intrinsically low validity, and is strongly confounded with a variety of extraneous factors that are unrelated to research performance.
