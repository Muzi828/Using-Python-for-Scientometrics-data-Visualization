This paper presents a Sciento-text framework to characterize and assess research performance of leading world institutions in fine-grained thematic areas. While most of the popular university research rankings rank universities either on their overall research performance or on a particular subject, we have tried to devise a system to identify strong research centres at a more fine-grained level of research themes of a subject. Computer science (CS) research output of more than 400 universities in the world is taken as the case in point to demonstrate the working of the framework. The Sciento-text framework comprises of standard scientometric and text analytics components. First of all every research paper in the data is classified into different thematic areas in a systematic manner and then standard scientometric methodology is used to identify and assess research strengths of different institutions in a particular research theme (say Artificial Intelligence for CS domain). The performance of framework components is evaluated and the complete system is deployed on the Web at url: www. universityselectplus. com. The framework is extendable to other subject domains with little modification.
