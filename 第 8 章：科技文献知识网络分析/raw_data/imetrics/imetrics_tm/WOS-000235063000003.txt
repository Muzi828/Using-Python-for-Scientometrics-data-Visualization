Many abstracts submitted to medical meetings never come to full publication in peer-reviewed journals. From the 2,992 abstracts presented at the 1994-1998 Spanish Congresses of Radiology, 464 (15%) were published as full articles in journals covered by the Medline and IME (Aindice Medico Espanol), the Spanish medical database. The publication rate of oral presentations was higher than that of posters (18% versus 13%). Collaboration between radiologists and clinicians and between radiologists from different institutions increased full publication (21% and 27%, respectively) compared to abstracts from just one institution (14%). Therefore, oral presentations, multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration in the abstract predicted full publication.
