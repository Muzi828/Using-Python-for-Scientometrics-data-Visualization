Are institutional repositories mere warehouses for digital documents or are they in fact establishing themselves as a rigorous option for the spread of scientific knowledge? This study analyses the competitive environment of the Top100 university repositories, defined as leaders in terms of market participation and penetration. The study also analyses the basic functionalities of preservation and diffusion of academic production through factors related to the prestige of the repositories and of the institutions that operate them. The results show that repositories with a larger digital academic supply are associated with the production of demonstrated scientific rigor.
