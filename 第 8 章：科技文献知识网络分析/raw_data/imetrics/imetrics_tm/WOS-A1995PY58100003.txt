The development of a set of bibliometric tools to contribute to the assessment and monitoring of utility of university and non-university research institutes to society is described.  Trade publications were weighted according to the utility of the journals for relevant nonscientific user groups.  Furthermore, one indicator addresses the extent to which a general or a specific type of audience is addressed.  Results are shown for one university and one university department.  In general, validation interviews show that the indicator provide a good first estimation of the potential effectivity of the knowledge transfer efforts by means of publications in trade journals to practice and policy bodies.
