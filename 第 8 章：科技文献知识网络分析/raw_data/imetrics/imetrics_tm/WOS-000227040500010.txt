This paper discusses the Thomson ISI Research Services Group approaches to analyzing the world research environment, particularly in terms of comparing research performance among nations and institutions.
This discussion concentrates on the recent research environment -1998-2002- beginning first with comparisons among selected nations overall, in terms of publications-an indicator of research output and productivity; and citations-an indicator of research impact and influence. The second part addresses the German research landscape and concludes with an analysis of the contributions of specific German institutions to Germanys' research performance.
