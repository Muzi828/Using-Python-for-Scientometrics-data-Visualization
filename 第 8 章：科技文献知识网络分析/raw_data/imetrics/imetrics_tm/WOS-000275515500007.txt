The study focuses on the analysis of the information flow among the ISI subject categories and aims at finding an appropriate field structure of the Web of Science using the subject clustering algorithm developed in previous studies. The clustering journals and ISI subject categories provide two subject classification schemes through different perspectives and levels. The two clustering results have been compared and their accordance and divergence have been analyzed. Several indicators have been used to compare the communication characteristics among different ISI subject categories. The neighbour map of each category clearly reflects the affinities between the "core" category and its satellites around. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
