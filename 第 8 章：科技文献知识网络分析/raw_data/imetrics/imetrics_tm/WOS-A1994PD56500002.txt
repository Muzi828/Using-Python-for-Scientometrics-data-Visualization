Geography, economic, socio-political and language are considered to be factors that effect the level of research collaboration.  However, to-date no technique has been developed to isolate the effect of geographical proximity from the other factors.  This paper presents a methodology for specifically examining geographical effects on intra-national scientific collaboration.  An investigation of intra-national university-university collaboration in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom using this technique demonstrates that research cooperation decreases exponentially with the distance separating the collaborative partners.
