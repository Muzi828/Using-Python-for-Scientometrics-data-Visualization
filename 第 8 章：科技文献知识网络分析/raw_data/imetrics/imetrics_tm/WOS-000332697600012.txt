By considering Korea's presidential election on December 19, 2012, this study examines how a presidential campaign can be measured using (negative) entropy indicators. We collected data from Google-indexed web documents, Twitter, and Facebook for four time periods. More specifically, we measured bilateral, trilateral, and quadruple relationships based on the number of web and social media mentions referring only to a candidate (this is, no mention of other candidates or the term "president"). The results indicate that Twitter tended to generate the highest entropy value across the three time periods but that President Geun-Hye Park outperformed the other candidates across all three periods on Google in terms of (negative) entropy indicators.
