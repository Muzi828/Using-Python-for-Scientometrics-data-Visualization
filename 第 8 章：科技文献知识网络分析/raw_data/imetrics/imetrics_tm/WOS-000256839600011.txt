In this paper we examine the applicability of the concept of h-index to topics, where a topic has index h, if there are h publications that received at least h citations and the rest of the publications on the topic received at most h citations. We discuss methodological issues related to the computation of h-index of topics (denoted h-b index by BANKS [2006]). Data collection for computing the h-b index is much more complex than computing the index for authors, research groups and/or journals, and has several limitations. We demonstrate the methods on a number of informetric topics, among them the h-index.
