In a reply to Jerome K. Vanclay's manuscript "Impact Factor: outdated artefact or stepping-stone to journal certification?" we discuss the value of journal metrics for the assessment of scientific-scholarly journals from a general bibliometric perspective, and from the point of view of creators of new journal metrics, journal editors and publishers. We conclude that citation-based indicators of journal performance are appropriate tools in journal assessment provided that they are accurate, and used with care and competence.
