This article reports the results of a study that investigated effects of four user characteristics on users' mental models of information retrieval systems: educational and professional status, first language, academic background, and computer experience. The repertory grid technique was used in the study. Using this method, important components of information retrieval systems were represented by nine concepts, based on four in experts' judgments. Users' mental models were represented by factor scores that were derived from users' matrices of concept ratings on different attributes of the concepts. The study found that educational and professional status, academic background, and computer experience had significant effects in differentiating users on their factor scores. First language had a borderline effect, but the effect was not significant enough at a = 0.05 level. Specific different Views regarding in systems among different groups of users are described and discussed. Implications of the study for information science and in system designs are suggested.
