Studying research productivity is a challenging task that is important for understanding how science evolves and crucial for agencies (and governments). In this context, we propose an approach for quantifying the scientific performance of a community (group of researchers) based on the similarity between its publication profile and a reference community's publication profile. Unlike most approaches that consider citation analysis, which requires access to the content of a publication, we only need the researchers' publication records. We investigate the similarity between communities and adopt a new metric named Volume Intensity. Our goal is to use Volume Intensity for measuring the internationality degree of a community. Our experimental results , using Computer Science graduate programs and including both real and random scenarios, show we can use publication profile as a performance indicator.
