The study analyses 27018 research papers published by India in condensed matter physics as seen from Science Citation Index-Extended Version (SCIE) (Web of Science) database for the period 1993-1995, 1996-1998 and 1999-2001. The study reports that condensed matter physics is the most sought after branch in physics research in India, accounting for 20% share of the country output in physics. The University & College sector as well as R&D sector are the major contributors to condensed matter physics. However, the country growth in this field, computed on six yearly basis, has still been negative (-1%) compared to 17.4% country growth in overall physics during the same period, 1993-1995 to 1999-2001. The study also maps condensed matter physics research on other dimensions such as institutional productivity, nature of collaboration in research, and institutional specialization. It examines highly cited papers, and lists prominent and productive scientists in this field. It also provides suggestions for accelerating condensed matter research in India.
