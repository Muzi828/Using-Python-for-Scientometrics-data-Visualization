This paper studies four different h-index sequences (different in publication periods and/or citation periods). Lotkaian models for these h-index sequences are presented by mutual comparison of one sequence with another one.
We also give graphs of these h-sequences for this author on which a discussion is presented. The same is done for the g-index and the R-index.
