Performance indicators were built for the Institute de Biofisica Carlos Chagas Filho, one of the most well-reputed Brazilian science centers. The Institute's performance presents a positive trend - articles number have doubled (1981-1995), and the articles impact grew from 4.20, in 1981, to 7.78, in 1990. This trend is probably being influenced by increasingly human resources involved in the Institute's scientific activities and by the continuous growth of national and international collaboration. The follow up of indicators trends can be useful for the evaluation of long term policies directed to implement human resources programs and institutional collaborative work among scientific institutions.
