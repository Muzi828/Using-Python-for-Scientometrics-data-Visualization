This paper traces the history of China Scientific and Technical Papers and Citations database (CSTPC) since its founding in 1988. The fact that most Chinese scientists publish their research results in Chinese journals requires that China establish SCI counterparts dedicated to domestic S & T journals. The article describes the selection criteria for source journals, the approach used to adjust the structure of source journals, the criteria for selecting items to be included in the database, and the indexing method. Then it discusses the impact upon government R & D administration agencies and the science community in general by both CSTPC team and CSTPC database. Finally, the article analyzes the main factors that lead to the primary success of CSTPD. The authors encourages information workers in other non-English developing countries to build up similar databases.
