One of the major questions in science research is addressed in detail, that is the problem of evaluation of research work both by objective characterization, accessible to proof, and by adequate characterization, referring to the content and cognitive level of the work under investigation.  A short discussion of established methods by science indicators as well as by peer review compiles merits and shortcomings of these methods.  A short review refers to a few approaches towards the development of criteria for an improved assessment and characterization of research work and their shortcomings are discussed.  Notably for the evaluation of medium or low range quality no reliable method is available.  Therefore a systematic compilation of criteria which covers the full range of excellence to failure with respect to scientific quality is developed and a comprehensive list of criteria is presented which should provide a basis both for objective and adequate characterization of publications.
