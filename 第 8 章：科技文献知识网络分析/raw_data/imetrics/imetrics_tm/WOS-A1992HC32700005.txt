A bibliometric study using the lists of publications and work of 207 scientists working in Asia, Latin America and Africa was conducted.  Number of authored and co-authored articles published in scientific journals and bulletins, conference papers, books, chapters of books, reports were taken into consideration to measure the total scientific output.  Local vs. international production was also determined by scientific fields, geographic areas, sexe and language of publication.  Co-authorship studies were also used to particularly measure the degree of collaboration and dependence of Developing Countries' (DC) scientists on foreign co-authors.  An analysis of the references used (age, origins) was also made.  Conclusions drawn concern the comparatively specific nature of science produces by DC's researcher.  Partly given the importance of the scientific production published in local journals, the inadequacy of international databases to study Dc science is confirmed.  Most of the DC scientists publish in both national and international journals.  They often cite their colleagues from the developed countries but their own work being less "visible" is seldom cited.
