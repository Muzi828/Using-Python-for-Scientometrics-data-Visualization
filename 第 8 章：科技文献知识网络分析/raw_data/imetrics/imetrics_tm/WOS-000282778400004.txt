Many studies have demonstrated that people engage in a variety of different information behaviors when engaging in information seeking. However, standard information retrieval systems such as Web search engines continue to be designed to support mainly one such behavior, specified searching. This situation has led to suggestions that people would be better served by information retrieval systems which support different kinds of information-seeking strategies. This article reports on an experiment comparing the retrieval effectiveness of an integrated interactive information retrieval (IIR) system which adapts to support different information-seeking strategies with that of a standard baseline IIR system. The experiment, with 32 participants each searching on eight different topics, indicates that using the integrated IIR system resulted in significantly better user satisfaction with search results, significantly more effective interaction, and significantly better usability than that using the baseline system.
