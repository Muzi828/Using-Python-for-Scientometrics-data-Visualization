The study investigated industrial interactions in science and 'applied science' departments of seven universities in India. Motivating factors and constraints perceived by university departments and the role of the government in initiating and sustaining interactions were examined.
Different types of interactions with industry were exhibited in the seven selected universities. Some specific initiatives like creation of special centers to facilitate interaction with industry were observed in the majority of the selected universities. Personal contact was indicated as the major motivator in the initiation of linkages. The government had taken some important initiatives to strengthen the university-industry link. The study points to the need of developing further linkages so that they can lead to successful and mutually beneficial outcomes for both university and industry.
