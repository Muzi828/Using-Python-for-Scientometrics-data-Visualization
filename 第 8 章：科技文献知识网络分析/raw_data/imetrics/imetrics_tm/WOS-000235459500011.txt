We point out that question-answering systems differ from other information-seeking applications, such as search engines, by having a deduction capability, an ability to answer questions by a synthesis of information residing in different parts of its knowledge base. This capability requires appropriate representation of various types of human knowledge, rules for locally manipulating this knowledge, and a framework for providing a global plan for appropriately mobilizing the information in the knowledge to address the question posed. In this article we suggest tools to provide these capabilities. We describe how the fuzzy set-based theory of approximate reasoning can aid in the process of representing knowledge. We discuss how protoforms can be used to aid in deduction and local manipulation of knowledge. The idea of a knowledge tree is introduced to provide a global framework for mobilizing the knowledge base in response to a query. We look at some types of common-sense and default knowledge. This requires us to address the complexity of the nonmonotonicity that these types of knowledge often display. We also briefly discuss the role that Dempster-Shafer structures can play in representing knowledge.
