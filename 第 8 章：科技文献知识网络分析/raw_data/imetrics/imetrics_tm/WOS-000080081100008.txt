International scientific cooperation of Latin American countries amongst themselves, with the USA and with the European Union in the period 1991-1995 was studied. The analysis deepens in the differences per subject area and the influence of the regional axis involved. Collaboration patterns differ according to the scientific size of the Latin American countries, the thematic areas and whether a bilateral collaboration or a participation in a multilateral network takes place. Some special characteristics of multi-regional cooperation networks are presented.
