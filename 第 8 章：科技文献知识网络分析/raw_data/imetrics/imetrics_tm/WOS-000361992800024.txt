In the 1980s, Morocco was vowed to be a leader country of scientific research and output in North Africa. However, the scientific output underwent stagnation and even decline in the mid-2000s relegating Morocco to the last rank of the Maghreb countries. Analysis of the effects of several major governmental decisions taken in the 2000s, shows a clear impact on research activity. The major decisions that have had the most important negative impact are: (1) the use of different scientific languages in schools and universities, (2) abolition of the State Doctorate, (3) the promotion system of professors, (4) the complex bureaucracy of project management, (5) the Voluntary Departure initiative, (6) administrative equivalence of Master and PhD, (7) teaching pressure in universities, (8) ageing of professors and supporting administrative personnel, (9) preference given to expertise over research activity, (10) fled of PhD students.
