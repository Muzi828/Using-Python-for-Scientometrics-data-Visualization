The theory behind InCommonSense is based on research findings from the fields of linguistics, psychology, HCl, sociology, and information retrieval. The theoretical background for finding and reusing conventions in hypertext is discussed, and the possibilities of extending the system to improve existing hypertext systems and creating new futuristic hypertext meanings (in particular on the Web) are examined.
