This article examines the contrast between Brazil's impressive scientific development over the last 25 years and its lagging innovative capacity. As the world's eighth largest economy, an evaluation of this link offers insights, not only for Brazil, but also for parallel developments in other emerging countries. The growth rate of Brazilian scientific production has exceeded the international average, showing a six-fold increase in the last twenty-five years. However, Brazil's innovation capability is still unsatisfactory and, in contrast to its scientific production, is failing to grow significantly. This hiatus between the generation of science and innovation is also typical of other emergent countries. A possible remedy is suggested: interaction with universities and research centers is particularly necessary for Brazilian companies - far more so than in industrialized countries.
