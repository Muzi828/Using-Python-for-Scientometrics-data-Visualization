A comparison has been carried out between the scientific production of Turkish physicists in the periods 1961-1971 and 1994-2000, by considering articles (written singly or in collaboration with scientists of different nationalities) which have received at least ten citations. The results show that in 30 years, appreciable increases have occurred in the number of authors making significant contributions and in the number of papers based on research carried out in Turkey.
