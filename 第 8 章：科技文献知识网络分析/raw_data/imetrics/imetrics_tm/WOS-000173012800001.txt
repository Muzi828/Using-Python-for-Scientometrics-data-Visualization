There has been an increased growth in the use of hypermedia to deliver learning and teaching material. However, much remains to be learned about how different learners perceive such systems. Therefore, it is essential to build robust learning models to illustrate how hypermedia features are experienced by different learners. Research into individual differences suggests cognitive styles have a significant effect on student learning in hypermedia systems. In particular, Witkin's Field Dependence has been extensively examined in previous studies. This article reviews the published findings from empirical studies of hypermedia learning. Specifically, the review classifies the research into five themes: nonlinear learning, learner control, navigation in hyperspace, matching and mismatching, and learning effectiveness. A learning model, developed from an analysis of findings of the previous studies, is presented. Finally, implications for the design of hypermedia learning systems are discussed.
