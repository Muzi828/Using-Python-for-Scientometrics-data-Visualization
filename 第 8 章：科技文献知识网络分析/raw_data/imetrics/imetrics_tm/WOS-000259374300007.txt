In order to identify the indicators having world-wide standards for the assessment of scientific performances at the level of both individual and institutions normalized for disciplines, we have carried out a comparative analysis of the relative scientific and technological level of individual scientists and individual scientific institutions competing internationally for given fields, using alternative indicators all based on the number of publications and on their impact factors in international SCI journals properly ranked properly weighted for their position, number of coauthors and discipline using deciles. This study, contrary to some gloomy opinions, suggests that interesting conclusions can be drawn from the above indicators. The utilization of the chosen indicators, tested world-wide in real situations, appears capable to effectively and objectively assess institutions and individual university professors and researchers proving to be quite significant and should be used to provide computer-assisted evaluation criteria for either maintaining or upgrading the given position, maintaining or closing public Institutions, and filtering grant applications.
