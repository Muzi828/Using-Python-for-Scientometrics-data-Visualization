Recent work by Evans, Cordova, and Sipole (2014) reveals that in the two months leading up to the 2012 election, female House candidates used the social media site Twitter more often than male candidates. Not only did female candidates tweet more often, but they also spent more time attacking their opponents and discussing important issues in American politics. In this article, we examine whether the female winners of those races acted differently than the male winners in the 2012 election, and whether they differed in their tweeting-style during two months in the summer of 2013. Using a hand-coded content analysis of every tweet from each member in the U.S. House of Representatives in June and July of 2013, we show that women differ from their male colleagues in their frequency and type of tweeting, and note some key differences between the period during the election and the period after. This article suggests that context greatly affects representatives' Twitter-style.
