The frame of reference of the study consists of theoretical concepts adopted from the diffusion of innovations theory. The study focuses on the diffusion of a formerly national scientific journal toward a more international audience, and on factors that have influenced the diffusion. The study is part of a larger project aiming to construct a model that describes the diffusion of a scientific journal towards an international audience based on the diffusion theory and a model of information acquisition.
