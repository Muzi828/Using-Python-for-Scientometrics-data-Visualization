Using the example of the 'h-related' publication dataset created for a previous study on the literature of Hirsch-type measures (Zhang et al. in J Informetri 5(3):583-593, 2011) and updated for the present paper, we attempt to study the robustness and dynamic evolution of 'core documents'. With using two different methods that have been recently introduced in the context of the detection and analysis of emerging topics (Glanzel and Thijs in Scientometrics 91(2):399-416, 2012), we show that the applied methods prove both stable and representative. Furthermore, the evolution of the core-document network represents and follows the general trends topic development in terms of focus shift from theory to application in an adequate manner.
