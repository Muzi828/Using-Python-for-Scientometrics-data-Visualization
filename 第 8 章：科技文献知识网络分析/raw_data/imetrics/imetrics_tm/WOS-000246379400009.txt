With domestic violence directly impacting over 5 million victims in the United States annually, the growing e-health and e-government networks are developing digitally based resources for both victims and those who aid them. The well-established community information and referral role of public libraries dovetails with this digital referral network model; however, no study of the actual service provided by public libraries is available. This examination of e-mail reference responses to requests for safe-house contact information revealed major gaps in cyber-safety awareness and uneven implementation of professional standards for virtual reference service. Implications for information system design, professional standards, education, and future research are discussed.
