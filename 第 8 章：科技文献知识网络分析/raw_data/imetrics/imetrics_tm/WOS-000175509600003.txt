This study applied the Biglan model of disciplinary differences to the information-seeking behavior patterns of 5,175 undergraduates responding to questions on the College Student Experiences Questionnaire (CSEQ). The Biglan model categorizes academic disciplines along three dimensions: (1) hard-soft, (2) pure-applied, and (3) life-nonlife systems. Using t-tests, this model proved to be valid for distinguishing differences in undergraduates' information-seeking behavior patterns among various academic disciplines. The results indicate that the Biglan model has implications for the redesign of academic library services and use as a valid theoretical framework for future library and information science research.
