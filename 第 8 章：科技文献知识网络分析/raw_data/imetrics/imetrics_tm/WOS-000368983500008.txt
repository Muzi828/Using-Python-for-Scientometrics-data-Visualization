Large amounts of health-related information of different types are available on the web. In addition to authoritative health information sites maintained by government health departments and healthcare institutions, there are many social media sites carrying user-contributed information. This study sought to identify the types of drug information available on consumer-contributed drug review sites when compared with authoritative drug information websites. Content analysis was performed on the information available for nine drugs on three authoritative sites (RxList, eMC, and PDRhealth) as well as three drug review sites (WebMD, RateADrug, and PatientsLikeMe). The types of information found on authoritative sites but rarely on drug review sites include pharmacology, special population considerations, contraindications, and drug interactions. Types of information found only on drug review sites include drug efficacy, drug resistance experienced by long-term users, cost of drug in relation to insurance coverage, availability of generic forms, comparison with other similar drugs and with other versions of the drug, difficulty in using the drug, and advice on coping with side effects. Drug efficacy ratings by users were found to be different across the three sites. Side effects were vividly described in context, with user assessment of severity based on discomfort and effect on their lives.
