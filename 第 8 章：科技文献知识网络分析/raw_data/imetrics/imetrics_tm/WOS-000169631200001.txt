Many international comparisons of the publication performance at the macro level are based on direct counts of citation frequencies in the Science Citation Index. However, these comparisons may reveal a significant negative language bias for non-English-speaking countries, or other selection biases, which can be illustrated by the relation between research budgets of scientific institutions and SCI publications. Against this background, a two-dimensional representation, specifying for the international alignment of the national publications and the journal-standardized citation impact, proves to be a more appropriate indicator base to assess the citation performance of countries such as Germany. In the light of a ten countries' benchmark, time series of these indicators for the nineties show a considerable impact of the German unification with a recent trend towards an adaptation of publication behaviour in East Germany towards the Western patterns.
