A fundamental aspect of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is the extraction and the representation of a visual feature that is an effective discriminant between pairs of images. Among the many visual features that have been studied, the distribution of color pixels in an image is the most common visual feature studied. The standard representation of color for content-based indexing in image databases is the color histogram. Vector-based distance functions are used to compute the similarity between two images as the distance between points in the color histogram space. This paper proposes an alternative real valued representation of color based on the information theoretic concept of entropy. A theoretical presentation of image entropy is accompanied by a practical description of the merits and limitations of image entropy compared to color histograms. Specifically, the L-1 norm for color histograms is shown to provide an upper bound on the difference between image entropy values. Our initial results suggest that image entropy is a promising approach to image description and representation.
