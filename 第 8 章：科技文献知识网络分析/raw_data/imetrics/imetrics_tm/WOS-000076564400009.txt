This paper argues the convenience of considering multiple databases in order to obtain a reliable set of scientific indicators in case of fields that includes a variety of disciplines. With this aim we analyse the Spanish scientific output in Plant Sciences regarding mainstream literature covered by SCI database and that published in domestic journals covered by ICYT database. This method allows us to obtain two different profiles of research. These results clearly underly the need to consider these databases jointly, thus avoiding potential inaccuracies induced by the use of the SCI as the only information source to be considered for the assessment of research.
