The paper pursues the rigorous mathematical study of the Hirsch index and shows that it has power law upper tail distribution and determines the exponent provided that the underlying publication and citation distributions have fat tails as well. The result is demonstrated on the distribution of the Hirsch index of journals. The paper is concluded with some further remarks on the Hirsch index.
