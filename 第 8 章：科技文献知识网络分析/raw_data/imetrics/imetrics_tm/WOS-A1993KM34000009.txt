In order to attribute journals to specialties in a dynamic journal set by using aggregated journal-journal citations derived from the Science Citation Index, it is necessary to complement the multi-variate analysis of this data with a time-series perspective. This calls for a more analytical approach to the problem of choice among the many possible parameters for clustering. Changes in the disciplinary structure of science are tracked by using the differences among the multi-variate analyses for the various years. It is impossible to attribute change systematically to structure, noise, or deviance if these uncertainties are not clearly defined ex ante. The study discusses the various choices which have to be made, in both conceptual and methodological terms In addition to hierarchies among journals, one has to assume heterarchy among journal groups (and their centroids). For comprehensive mapping, a concept of 'macro-journals' as representations of a density of points in the multi-dimensional space is defined. Empirical results indicate the feasibility of dynamic journal-journal mapping by using these methods.
