Reviews the current state of science and technology in the Muslim world in the light of the CASTASIA 1968 and the International Conference on Science in Islamic Polity 1983 recommendations of allocating 1.0 percent of GNP for R&D. The data presented indicates that the Muslim countries have not been able to achieve this target. OIC countries on the average spend 0.45 percent of their GNP on R&D as compared to 2.30 percent by OECD countries. Egypt which leads the Muslim countries spends 0.86 percent of its GNP on R&D as compared to 2.27 percent by Israel. Indonesia spends 0.17 percent as compared to 1.78 percent by Taiwan. Annual growth of R&D expenditure in a few Muslim countries, especially Turkey and Malaysia, is very encouraging. Muslims are also far behind in terms of R&D manpower. OIC countries have 8.5 scientists, engineers and technicians per 1,000 population as compared to 40.7 of world average and 139.3 for OECD countries. The contribution of Muslim countries to world science literature is also meagre. Forty-six Muslim countries contribute 1.17 percent to world science literature as compared to 1.66 percent by India and 1.48 percent by Spain. Twenty Arab countries contribute 0.55 percent as compared to 0.89 percent by Israel alone. Contribution to science literature is also analyzed on the basis of total population, literate population, and GNP per capita. Growth of science literature in many Muslim countries is faster than OECD countries.
