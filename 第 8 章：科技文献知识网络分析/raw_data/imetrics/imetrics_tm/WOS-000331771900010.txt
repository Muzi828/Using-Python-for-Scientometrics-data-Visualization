Dynamic development is an intrinsic characteristic of research topics. To study this, this paper proposes two sets of topic attributes to examine topic dynamic characteristics: topic continuity and topic popularity. Topic continuity comprises six attributes: steady, concentrating, diluting, sporadic, transforming, and emerging topics; topic popularity comprises three attributes: rising, declining, and fluctuating topics. These attributes are applied to a data set on library and information science publications during the past 11 years (2001-2011). Results show that topics on "web information retrieval", "citation and bibliometrics", "system and technology", and "health science" have the highest average popularity; topics on "h-index", "online communities", "data preservation", "social media", and "web analysis" are increasingly becoming popular in library and information science.
