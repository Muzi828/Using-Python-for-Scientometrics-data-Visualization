An analysis of 2058 papers published by Chinese authors and 2678 papers published by Indian authors in the field of computer science during 1971-2000 indicates that India's output is significantly higher than the Chinese output. However, China is catching up fast. Chinese researchers prefer to publish their research results in domestic journals, while Indian researchers prefer to publish their research results in journals published in the advanced countries of the West. Also the share of papers in journals covered by SCI for India was higher than from China. However, no significant difference has been observed in the impact of the research output of the two countries as seen by different impact indicators. Team research is more common in India as compared to China.
