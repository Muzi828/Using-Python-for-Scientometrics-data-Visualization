Intellectual Structure (IS) is a bibliometric method that is widely applied in knowledge domain analysis and in science mapping. An intellectual structure consists of clusters of related documents ascribed to individual factors. Documents ascribed to a factor are generally associated with a common research theme. As such, the contents of documents ascribed to a factor are theorized to be similar to each other. This study shows that the link-based relatedness implies content-based similarity. The intellectual structures of two research domains were derived from data sets retrieved from the Microsoft Academic Search database. The collection of documents ascribed to a factor is referred to as a factor-based document cluster, which the content-based document clusters are compared with. All documents in an intellectual structure are re-clustered based on their content similarity, which is derived from the cosine of their vector form encoded in documents' term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighted terms. The factor-based document clusters are then compared with the content-based clusters for congruity. We used the Rand index and kappa coefficient to check the congruity between the factor-based and content-based document clusters. The kappa coefficient indicates that there is fair to moderate agreement between the clusters derived from these two different bases.
