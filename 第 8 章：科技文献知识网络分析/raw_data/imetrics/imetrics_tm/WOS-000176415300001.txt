A new citation search strategy is proposed for Information Retrieval (IR) based on the principle of polyrepresentation (Ingwersen, 1992, 1996). The strategy exploits logical overlaps between a range of cognitively different interpretations of the same documents in a structured manner, i.e. so-called cognitive overlaps of representations. The strategy is essentially a 'cycling strategy' starting with documents retrieved by a subject search, wherefrom new documents are identified automatically by following the network of citations in scientific papers backwards and forwards in time. In contrast to earlier citation search strategies the proposed strategy does not require known relevant documents (seed documents) as a starting point, but may be based on a subject search. A pilot study is reported where the ability of the strategy to retrieve additional relevant documents is analysed. Results show that a very large amount of documents can be retrieved by the strategy, and that these may be segmented in a number of distinct 'overlap levels'. It is demonstrated that the combined core of the higher-level overlaps contains higher relevance density than found in the original retrieval results. Based on these results it is suggested that the documents be displayed in order of their presence in higher-level overlaps, so as to maximise the chances that as many relevant documents as possible will be presented first to a user.
