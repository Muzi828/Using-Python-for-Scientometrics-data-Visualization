We report findings from a recent study of how public libraries are using on-line community networks to facilitate the public's information seeking and use in everyday situations. These networks have been lauded for their potential to strengthen physical communities through increasing information flow about local services and events, and through facilitating civic interaction. However, little is known about how the public uses such digital services and what barriers they encounter. This article presents findings from a 2-year study that comprised a national survey with public library staff, followed by extensive case studies in three states. At each site, data were collected using on-line surveys, field observation, in-depth interviews, and focus groups with Internet users, human service providers, and library staff. The on-line surveys and the follow-up interviews with respondents were based on sense-making theory. In our article we discuss: (1) how the public is using networked community information systems and the Internet for daily problem solving, (2) the types of barriers users encounter, and (3) the benefits for individuals and physical communities from public library-community networking initiatives and the emergence of "information communities."
