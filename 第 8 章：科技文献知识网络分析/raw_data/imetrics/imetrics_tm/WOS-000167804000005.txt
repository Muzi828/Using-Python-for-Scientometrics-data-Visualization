Many people fail to property evaluate Internet information. This is often due to a lack of understanding of the issues surrounding evaluation and authority, and, more specifically, a lack of understanding of the structure and modi operandi of the Internet and the Domain Name System. The fact that evaluation is not being properly performed on Internet information means both that questionable information is being used recklessly, without adequately assessing its authority, and good information is being disregarded, because trust in the information is lacking. Both scenarios may be resolved by ascribing proper amounts of cognitive authority to Internet information. Traditional measures of authority present in a print environment are lacking on the Internet, and, even when occasionally present, are of questionable veracity. A formal model and evaluative criteria are herein suggested and explained to provide a means for accurately ascribing cognitive authority in a networked environment; the model is unique in its representation of overt and covert affiliations as a mechanism for ascribing proper authority to Internet information.
