Newly introduced bibliometric indices may be biased by the preference of scientists for bibliometric indices, in which their own research receives a high score. To test such a hypothesis, the publication and citation records of nine scientists who recently proposed new bibliometric indices were analyzed in terms of standard indicators, their own indicators, and indicators recently proposed by other scientists. The result of the test was negative, that is, newly introduced bibliometric indices did not favor their authors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
