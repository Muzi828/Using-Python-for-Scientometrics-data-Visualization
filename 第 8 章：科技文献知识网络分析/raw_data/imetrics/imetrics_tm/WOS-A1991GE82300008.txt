In this study, a network management approach to science policy decision-making guided our efforts to develop new co-word analysis techniques for the evaluation of regional research policies. A rich collection of factual data was gathered on inputs into the local research system (funding, personnel, equipment, ...). This data was then combined with the results of a co-word analysis of the region's publication output. The network management approach is useful in helping to determine the nature of input/output relationships in a regional context.
