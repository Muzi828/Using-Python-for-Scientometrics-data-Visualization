This paper measures the increase in the numbers of authors per article in one scientific journal over forty years.  The rise in the complexity of science, to which some attribute this growth in multiple authorship, is reflected in the increasing complexity of this simple task over that forty year period.  It also discusses the resulting decrease in single authored papers, papers with very large numbers of authors, and predicts future trends.
