This paper presents the results of an evaluation of the national research system in Morocco. The exercise focuses on the period 1997-2006 and includes a comparison with South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Tunisia, Algeria, Portugal and Greece. Ratings of highly ranked researchers are developed on the basis of their number of publications, number of citations and also their 'h-index' (or Hirsch index). Finally, we examine the empirical model set by Glanzel that related the h-index to the number of publications and the mean citation rate per paper for these 'upper-class' researchers. The use of this model confirms that the h-index is likely to reflect the importance and the quality of the scientific output of a given researcher.
