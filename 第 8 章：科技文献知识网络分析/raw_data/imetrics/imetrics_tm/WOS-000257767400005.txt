In order to take multiple co-authorship appropriately into account, a straightforward modi. cation of the Hirsch index was recently proposed. Fractionalised counting of the papers yields an appropriate measure which is called the h(m)-index. The effect of this procedure is compared in the present work with other variants of the h-index and found to be superior to the fractionalised counting of citations and to the normalization of the h-index with the average number of authors in the h-core. Three fictitious examples for model cases and one empirical case are analysed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
