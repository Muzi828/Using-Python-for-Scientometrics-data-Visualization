An outcome of nuclear safety research (NSR) done by JAERI (Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute) was case studied by the bibliometric method. (1) For LOCA (loss-of-coolant accident) a domestic share of JAERI in monoclinic research paper was 63% at the past (20) 1978-1982 but was decreased to 40% at the present 1998-2002. For co-authored papers a domestic share between JAERI and PS (public sectors) was zero at past (20) but increased to 4% at the present. Research cooperation is active between Tokyo University and JAERI or between JAERI and Nagoya University. (2) It is revealed that LOCA outputs born by NSR-JAERI reflected partly to those of the Safety Licensing Guidelines, however, a share of NSR-JAERI could not determined due to the lack of necessary information in the Guideline.
