Using the artificial example of perfectly stratified samples, we have shown the effect different sampling designs have on the determination of concentration values. More concretely, we have studied the following four cases: sampling of items in the case the number of sources is known (we have further considered the cases when there are 'many' items in every source and when this is not so); sampling of items in the case the number of sources is unknown, and finally, sampling of sources.
