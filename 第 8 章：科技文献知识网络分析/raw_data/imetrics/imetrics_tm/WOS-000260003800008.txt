Using a database for publications established at CEST and covering the period from 1981 to 2002 the differences in national scores obtained by different Counting methods have been measured. The results are supported by analysing data from the literature. Special attention has been paid to the comparison between the EU and the USA. There are big differences between scores obtained by different methods. In one instance the reduction in scores going from whole to complete-normalized (fractional) counting is 72 per cent. In the literature there is often not enough information given about methods used, and no sign of a clear and consistent terminology and of agreement on properties of and results from different methods. As a matter of fact, Whole counting is favourable to certain countries, especially countries with a high level of international cooperation. The problems are increasing with time because of the ever-increasing national and international cooperation in research and the increasing average number of authors per publication. The need for a common understanding and a joint effort to rectify the situation is stressed.
