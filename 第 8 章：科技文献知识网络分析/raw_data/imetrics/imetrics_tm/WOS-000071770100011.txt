The publication and coauthorship patterns between 1980-1994 of 15 highly productive Mexican scientists were studied in relation to their 565 research papers involving only national institutions and 232 published with colleagues from abroad. Three scientists were selected from each of the following areas: Biomedicine, Chemistry, Physics, Astronomy and Astrophysics, and Geosciences. Parameters studied were: vehicles used for publication; document types; number of authors; collaborating countries; and author position. The results are discussed in relation to Mexico's peripheral position with regard to the scientific center, and the increasing internationalization of Mexican science.
