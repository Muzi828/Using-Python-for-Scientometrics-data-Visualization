We present the results on the relationship between the bonding number (the number of links among the authors of an article) and a measure of group cohesiveness on a Likert-type scale in three research areas, Biotechnology, Mathematics and Physics, at the National University of Mexico (UNAM). We found a difference between disciplines with regard to group size, and although there is little difference between disciplines in cohesiveness, results suggest that there is a direct relationship between the level of cohesiveness and the bonding number in Physics and Biotechnology, but not in Mathematics where the groups are much smaller.
