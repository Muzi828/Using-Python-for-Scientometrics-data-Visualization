The increasing amount of publicly available literature and experimental data in biomedicine makes it hard for biomedical researchers to stay up-to-date. Genescene is a toolkit that will help alleviate this problem by providing an overview of published literature content. We combined a linguistic parser with Concept Space, a cooccurrence based semantic net. Both techniques extract complementary biomedical relations between noun phrases from MEDLINE abstracts. The parser extracts precise and semantically rich relations from individual abstracts. Concept Space extracts relations that hold true for the collection of abstracts. The Gene Ontology, the Human Genome Nomenclature, and the Unified Medical Language System, are also integrated in Genescene. Currently, they are used to facilitate the integration of the two relation types, and to select the more interesting and high-quality relations for presentation. A user study focusing on p53 literature is discussed. All MEDLINE abstracts discussing p53 were processed in Genescene. Two researchers evaluated the terms and relations from several abstracts of interest to them. The results show that the terms were precise (precision 93%) and relevant, as were the parser relations (precision 95%). The Concept Space relations were more precise when selected with ontological knowledge (precision 78%) than without (60%).
