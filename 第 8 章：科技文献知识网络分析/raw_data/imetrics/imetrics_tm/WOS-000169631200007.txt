The differentiation of scientific fields into sub-fields can be studied on the level of the 'scientific content' of the sub-field, that is on the level of the products, as well as on the level of the 'social structures' of the sub-field, that is on the lever of the producers of the content. By comparing the behavior of the constructs with the behavior of the constructors, we are able to demonstrate the analytical distinction between a cognitive and a social approach in an empirical way.
This will be illustrated using the case of integration and differentiation in Science and Technology Studies (STS), Elsewhere, using relations between documents, I showed how STS is characterized by strong differentiation tendencies. In this paper I address the question to what extent this differentiation is also reflected in the social structure of the STS field. Can STS scholars and STS research groups be classified in terms of the sub-fields? Or do researchers and institutes carry an integrative role in the STS field? Are the relations between the sub-fields of STS maintained by individual researchers or research institutes, and to what extent? The analysis in this paper reveals that this is generally not the case. Although we are able to distinguish analytically between the cognitive and social dimension of the development of the research field, we find similar patterns of differentiation an the social level too. At the same time, this differentiation differs in some respects from the cognitive differentiation pattern.
Consequently, the social and the cognitive dimensions of the STS field are not independent as no serious STS scholar would argue - but also not identical, as radical constructivists claim, but are strongly interacting Further analysis may reveal the leading dynamics, that is answering the question whether the 'social' follows the 'cognitive', the other way around, or whether the dynamics has the pattern of 'co-evolution'.
