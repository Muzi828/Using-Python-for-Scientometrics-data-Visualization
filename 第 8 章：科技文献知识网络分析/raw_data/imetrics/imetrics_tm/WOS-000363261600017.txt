We have analyzed in detail the physiology field in the Czech Republic and Hungary. Apart from classic descriptive bibliometric analysis we have also tried to compare research directions and topics inside the physiology field in the Czech Republic and Hungary with the world trends. For this purpose we have employed bibliometric mapping using the computer program VOSviewer. In conclusion, the Czech physiology field is quickly growing and catching up with the world average in respect of the publication production. Hungarian physiology field is growing only moderately. Citation impact of publications of both countries is lagging behind the field standards. International collaboration rate of the publications (co)authored by the Czech researchers has been considerably lower than that of Hungarian or other comparable European researchers. VOSviewer mapping indicated that Czech and Hungarian authors have been involved in less than 25 % of the physiology topics. The research topics of both countries have been considerably different; the share of the phrases with participation of both countries ranged from about 2 % in 1994 to 9 % in 2009. The analysis also indicates that low citation impact of the Czech and Hungarian publications is not due to the selection of less-cited research topics by the domestic researchers.
