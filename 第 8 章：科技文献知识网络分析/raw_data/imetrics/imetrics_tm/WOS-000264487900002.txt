Research on the effects of collaboration in scientific research has been increasing in recent years. A variety of studies have been done at the institution and country level, many with an eye toward policy implications. However, the question of how to identify the most fruitful targets for future collaboration in high-performing areas of science has not been addressed. This paper presents a method for identifying targets for future collaboration between two institutions. The utility of the method is shown in two different applications: identifying specific potential collaborations at the author level between two institutions, and generating an index that can be used for strategic planning purposes. Identification of these potential collaborations is based on finding authors that belong to the same small paper-level community (or cluster of papers), using a map of science and technology containing nearly 1 million papers organized into 117,435 communities. The map used here is also unique in that it is the first map to combine the ISI Proceedings database with the Science and Social Science Indexes at the paper level.
