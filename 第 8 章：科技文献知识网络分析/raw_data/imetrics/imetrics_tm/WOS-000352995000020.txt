In order to distinguish the research focus between different Library and Information Science (LIS) research institutions in China, we use the Keyword Activity Index (KAI) to identify their institution-specific keywords. The KAI, whose idea is borrowed from the Activity Index, measures whether an institution has alternatively comparative advantage in a particular topic according to its share in publications. In this study, a total of 65,653 papers from 19 core LIS journals in China during the period of 2000-2013 are collected. The top 8 most prolific LIS research institutions in China are selected for further investigation of the utility of KAI. Their institution-specific keywords are extracted based on the KAI values to represent their research focus and then clustered using co-word analysis; the research advantages of each institution are analyzed and compared according to these clusters. The reasons of their research advantages are analyzed based on their research function and research background.
