We develop a context-based generic cross-lingual retrieval model that can deal with different language pairs. Our model considers contexts in the query translation process. Contexts in the query as well as in the documents based on co-occurrence statistics from different granularity of passages are exploited. We also investigate cross-lingual retrieval of automatic generic summaries. We have implemented our model for two different cross-lingual settings, namely, retrieving Chinese documents from English queries as well as retrieving English documents from Chinese queries. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a large-scale parallel corpus enabling studies on retrieval performance for two different cross-lingual settings of full-length documents as well as automated summaries.
