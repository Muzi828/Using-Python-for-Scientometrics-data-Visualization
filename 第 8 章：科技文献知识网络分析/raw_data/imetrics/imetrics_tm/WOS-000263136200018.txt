The Matthew effect has that recognition is bestowed on researchers of already high repute. If recognition is measured by citations, this means that often-cited papers or authors are cited more often. I use the statistical theory of the growth of firms to test whether the fame of papers and authors indeed exhibits increasing returns to scale, and confirm this hypothesis for the 100 most prolific economists.
