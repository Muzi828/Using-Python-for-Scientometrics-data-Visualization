This article describes the digital music library work at the University of Waikato, New Zealand. At the heart of the project is a music information retrieval workbench for evaluating algorithms and performing experiments used in conjunction with four datasets of symbolic notation ranging from contemporary to classical pieces. The outcome of this experimentation is woven together with strands from our larger digital library project to form the Web-based music digital library MELDEX (short for melody index). An overview of the workbench software architecture is given along with a description of how this fits the larger digital library design, followed by several examples of MELDEX in use.
