The institutional environment of science differs across countries. Its particularities have an impact on outcomes of scientific enterprise in terms of authorship patterns and patterns of citations. The paper analyzes scholarly papers produced by faculty and graduate students affiliated with six universities, two of them operate in the Russian institutional environment of science and four others-in the Western European and North American. The citation analysis of papers included in two major databases, eLibrary (Russian) and Web of Knowledge (international), shows that the lists of predictors for the number of references to a scholarly article significantly differ in the Western and Russian cases.
