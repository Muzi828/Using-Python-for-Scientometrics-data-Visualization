This paper reviews a variety of perspectives on citation. It argues that citations have multiple articulations in that they inform our understanding of the socio-cultural, cognitive, and textual aspects of scientific communication. Two metatheoretical frameworks are proposed as a means of negotiating the interpretative differences which characterize the various discourse communities concerned with citation theory and practice.
