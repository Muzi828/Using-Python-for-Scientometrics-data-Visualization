Academic and special libraries are in the midst of a shift toward hybrid collections. This shift from collection ownership to an information access model supports the distributed nature of learning and work. However, unanticipated consequences of these changes are emerging. One confounding result is a visible pattern of discontinuities in collections, with unique features for electronic products. Patterns of discontinuities encountered included the occurrence of intermittent holes and unintentionally masked information. This has both immediate and long-term implications for library users and services, and there are not yet coherent measures to assess these sorts of outcomes. A framework is required for the systematic evaluation of the effects of new systems such as bundled electronic resources. This research suggests that evaluating both use and non-use of electronic collections will supplement other acquisitions and service measures to support long-range planning and decision-making.
