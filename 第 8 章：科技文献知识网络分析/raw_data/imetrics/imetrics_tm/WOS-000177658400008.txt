This article reports findings from a study of the geographic distribution of foreign authors in the Journal of American Society for Information Science & Technology (JASIST) and Journal of Documentation (JDoc). Bibliographic data about foreign authors and their geographic locations from a 50-year publication period (1950-1999) are analyzed per 5-year period for both JASIST and JDoc. The distribution of foreign authors by geographic locations was analyzed for the overall trends in JASIST and JDoc. UK and Canadian authors are the most frequent foreign authors in JASIST. Authors from the United States and Canada are the most frequent foreign authors in JDoc. The top 10 geographic locations with highest number of foreign authors and the top 10 most productive foreign authors were also identified and compared for their characteristics and trends.
