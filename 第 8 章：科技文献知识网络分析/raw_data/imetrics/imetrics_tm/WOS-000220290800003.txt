This article proposes a method to design cataloging rules by utilizing conceptual modeling of the cataloging process and also by applying the concept "orientedness." It also proposes a general model for the cataloging process at the conceptual level, which is independent of any situation/system or cataloging code. A design method is made up of the following phases, including the development of a general model. Functional and non-functional requirements are first specified by use of orientedness. Also, cataloger tasks are defined, which are constituents of the cataloging process. Second, a core model is built, which consists of (1) basic event patterns under each task, (2) action patterns applicable to each event, and (3) orientedness involved in an event-action pair. Third, the core model is propagated to reflect the characteristics of an individual data element and also a certain class of materials. Finally, the propagated model is defined by choosing pairs of event and action patterns in the model while referring to orientedness indicated in each event-action pair, in order to match a particular situation. As a result, a set of event-action pairs reflecting specific requirements through categories of orientedness is obtained, and consistent and scalable design can, therefore, be attained.
