According to the discrete model of periodical publication process, recurrence formulae of parameters of the process are gained and the initial conditions of control process parameters from one steady state to another are deduced. Using the variable separation approach, which is used generally to solve the partial differential equation, the recurrence computing formula of the publication probability function is deduced. First the publication delay increasing process caused by the accepted contribution flux increase is simulated, and then the publication delay decreasing processes under four different control means are simulated too. Finally it is demonstrated that the periodical publishing process is a strong inertia system and it is found that reducing the quantity of deposited contributions can shorten the publication delay.
