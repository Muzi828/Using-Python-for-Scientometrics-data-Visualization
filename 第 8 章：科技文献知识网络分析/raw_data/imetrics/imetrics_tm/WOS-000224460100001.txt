This study analyzes the similarities and differences of performance of information management (IM) and knowledge management (KM) research publication indexed by the SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI and A&HCI databases since 1994 with informetric methods in order to explore a developing tendency in the near future. The bibliographic search supplied 1199 IM and 1063 KM records. A very few of IM and KM authors contributed two or more articles. Four countries dominated global IM and KM research productivity, while a few institutions played remarkable roles in scholarly activity. IM journals distributed widespread and 84 per cent just published one or two articles; KM publications were rather concentrated to core and borderline periodicals, fitting Bradford's law of scattering and. The result of Pearson's correlation coefficients analysis indicates that the higher the journal impact factor, the more times the published article is cited. The author concludes that KM has been leading IM in both publication productivity and academic population and the tendency is overwhelmingly growing.
