it is shown that the Journal Impact Factor as published by ISI - an indicator increasingly used as an measure for the quality of scientific journals - is misleading when two leading journals in chemistry, Angew. Chem., and J. Am. Chem. Sec., are compared. A detailed analysis of the various kinds publications in both journals over the period 1982-1994 shows that the overall impact factors based on publications and citations in two consecutive years for JACS communications (5.27 for 1993) are significantly higher than those of Angew. Chem. (3.26 for 1993). Even when all types of articles, i.e. including reviews, are included in the impact factors, JACS has a higher score than Angew. Chem. (5.07 vs. 4.03 in 1993). Critical and accurate analyses of citation figures is required when such data are used in science policy decisions, such as library subscriptions. It is proposed that when IF values for several journals are compared, only similar publication types are considered.
