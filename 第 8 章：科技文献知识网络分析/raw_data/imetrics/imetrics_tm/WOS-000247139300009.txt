We offer two metrics that together help gauge how interdisciplinary a body of research is. Both draw upon Web of Knowledge Subject Categories (SCs) as key units of analysis. We have assembled two Substantial Web of Knowledge samples from which to determine how closely individual SCs relate to each other. "Integration" measures the extent to which a research article cites diverse SCs. "Specialization" considers the spread of SCs in which the body of research (e.g., the work of a given author in a specified time period) is published. Pilot results for a sample of researchers show a surprising degree of interdisciplinarity.
