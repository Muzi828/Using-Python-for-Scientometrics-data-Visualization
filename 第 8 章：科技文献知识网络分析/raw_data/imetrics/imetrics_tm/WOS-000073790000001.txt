SCI data bases have been widely used to analyse scientific production of various nations, their position in the international research community as well as their fields specializations. In the present study we examined, within the same methodological framework, the impact of the drastic reorientation of science funding systems which occured in China (PRC) in the midst of the eighties. A decade after this turning point the pattern of Chinese publications from the 1994 SCI-CDRom reflects those of other countries although with its own peculiarities i.e. a relative weakness of life sciences and a prevalence of fundamental physics compared to the world average. Some effect of PRC's policy could nevertheless: be detected on this SCI profile like e.g. a neat increase of international papers after the opening of the country or the relatively high weight of collaborative works with laboratories from Hong Kong. We suggest that SCI data base is best suited for the analysis of public research of international standard due to the narrowness of the SCI window concerning applied research.
