A computer system combining hypertext and database management technologies is shown to be appropriate with the goals of information analysis. Such a system, HENOCH, designed to easily store any SGML document in a relational database, and to make these data accessible via the World Wide Web is exemplified in the particular case where the stored data is the result of clustering and mapping tools on bibliographic data. The software features of this system (genericity, reusability, extensibility) are explained and justified by the use of the SGML tree structure and the encapsulation of creation and manipulation functions of the relational database management system (RDBMS). The interest of WWW-RDBMS-based user interface is demonstrated by two complementary types of navigation for information analysis: an intuitive exploration mode based on the map metaphor and an assisted searching mode based on the "Who does What, and Where, with Whom" metaphor.
