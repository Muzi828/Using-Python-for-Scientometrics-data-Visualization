The author evaluates two major models of technological competitiveness of nations, and proposes a synthesized model based on their strengths and then complements it with additional measures. The paper addresses definition distinctions between the terms "competition" and "innovation", discusses the differing views on whether certain statistics are either input or output indicators, and reconsiders the relevance of the unit of analysis.
