A new paradigm for comparing quality of published papers across different disciplines has been proposed. This method uses a figure of merit of the ratio of actual citations received to the potential maximum number of citations that could have been received. It is analogous to approaches used to compare performance in physical systems, and appears intrinsically more useful than present approaches.
