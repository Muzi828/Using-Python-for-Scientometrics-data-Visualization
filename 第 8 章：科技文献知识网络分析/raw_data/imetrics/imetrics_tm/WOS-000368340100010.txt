Vast amounts of information are daily exchanged and/or released. The sensitive nature of much of this information creates a serious privacy threat when documents are uncontrollably made available to untrusted third parties. In such cases, appropriate data protection measures should be undertaken by the responsible organization, especially under the umbrella of current legislation on data privacy. To do so, human experts are usually requested to redact or sanitize document contents. To relieve this burdensome task, this paper presents a privacy model for document redaction/sanitization, which offers several advantages over other models available in the literature. Based on the well-established foundations of data semantics and information theory, our model provides a framework to develop and implement automated and inherently semantic redaction/sanitization tools. Moreover, contrary to ad-hoc redaction methods, our proposal provides a priori privacy guarantees which can be intuitively defined according to current legislations on data privacy. Empirical tests performed within the context of several use cases illustrate the applicability of our model and its ability to mimic the reasoning of human sanitizers.
