Science has become progressively more complex, requiring greater integration and collaboration between individuals, institutions and areas. Networking research establishes common rules and offers a suitable framework for this cooperation. Therefore, it is a good choice for both scientists and policy-makers. The objective of this study is to know whether the scientists perform better within these structures than outside them. As an example, we analysed the Biomedical Research Networking Centres in Spain and, for the exploratory investigation, we selected two disciplines (Psychiatry and Gastroenterology/Hepatology). The results showed that in every situation of networking research there were higher collaboration and impact rates. Furthermore, the main differences found between disciplines were related to the scope of cooperation, carried out at a more local level in Gastroenterology/Hepatology. Besides, HJ-Biplot technique allowed us to conclude that the outcomes may vary somewhat depending on the types of centres where the scientists work. Although further investigation is needed, the findings of this study might anticipate possible scenarios in which networking research could be the most natural way of collaboration.
