A recently suggested modification of the g-index is analysed in order to take multiple coauthorship appropriately into account. By fractionalised counting of the papers one can obtain an appropriate measure which I call g(m)-index. Two fictitious examples for model cases and two empirical cases are analysed. The results are compared with two other variants of the g-index which have also recently been proposed. Only the g(m)-index shows the correct behaviour when datasets are aggregated. The interpolated and continuous versions of the g-index and its variants are also discussed. For an intuitive comparison of the determination of the investigated variants of the h-index and the g-index, a visualization of the citation records is utilized. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
