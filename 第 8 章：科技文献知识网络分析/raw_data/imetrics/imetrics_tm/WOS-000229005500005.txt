Following a brief historical account of the initial difficulties of introducing modern sciences, especially the Western art of independent scientific inquiry, into Iran, using data obtained from the ISI (http://access.isiproducts.com/trials) an attempt is made to analyze the apparent present successes of Iranian scientists on the international science market. Using the corresponding ISI data of the publications (1990-2003) of 24 selected young chemistry Ph.D. graduates and present faculty members at various internal academia, a quantitative and qualitative assessment (www.geocities.com/iipopescu) of their achievements has been attempted and the results related to the strengths and weaknesses of the present science policy of the country.
