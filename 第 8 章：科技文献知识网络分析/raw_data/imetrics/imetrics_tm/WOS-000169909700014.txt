We argue in favour of artificial neural networks for exploratory data analysis, clustering and mapping. We propose the Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) for clustering and mapping according to a multi-maps extension. It is consequently called Multi-SOM. Firstly the Kohonen SOM algorithm is presented. Then the following improvements are detailed: the way of naming the clusters, the map division into logical areas, and the map generalization mechanism. The multi-map display founded on the inter-maps communication mechanism is exposed, and the notion of the viewpoint is introduced. The interest of Multi-SOM is presented for visualization, exploration or browsing, and moreover for scientific and technical information analysis. A case study in patent analysis on transgenic plants illustrates the use of the Multi-SOM. We also show that the inter-map communication mechanism provides support for watching the plants on which patented genetic technology works. It is the first map. The other four related maps provide information about the plant parts that are concerned, the target pathology, the transgenic techniques used for making these plants resistant, and finally the firms involved in genetic engineering and patenting. A method of analysis is also proposed in the use of this computer-based multi-maps environment. Finally, we discuss some critical remarks about the proposed approach at its current state. And we conclude about the advantages that it provides for a knowledge-oriented watching analysis on science and technology. In relation with this remark we introduce in conclusion the notion of knowledge indicators.
