This paper provides scientometricians with a brief overview of the history of economic statistics and its international standards. Part of the latter is the Frascati family of standards in science and technology input statistics. Some recommendations are given for improvements in these standards. Proposals are developed to relate research inputs as defined in the Frascati manual and bibliometrically measured outputs.
