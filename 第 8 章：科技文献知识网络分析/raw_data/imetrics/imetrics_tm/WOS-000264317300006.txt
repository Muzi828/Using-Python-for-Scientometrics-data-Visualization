The Hirsch index is a number that synthesizes a researcher's output. It is the maximum number h such that the researcher has h papers with at least h citations each. Woeginger [ Woeginger, G.J. (2008a). An axiomatic characterization of the Hirsch-index. Mathematical Social Sciences, 56( 2), 224-232; Woeginger, G.J. (2008b). A symmetry axiom for scientific impact indices. Journal of Informetrics, 2( 3), 298-303] characterizes the Hirsch index when indices are assumed to be integer-valued. In this note, the Hirsch index is characterized, when indices are allowed to be real-valued, by adding to Woeginger's monotonicity two axioms in a way related to the concept of monotonicity.
