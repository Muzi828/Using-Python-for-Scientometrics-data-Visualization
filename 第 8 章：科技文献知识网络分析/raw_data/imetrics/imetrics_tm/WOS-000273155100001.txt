To determine influences on the production of a scientific article, the content of the article must be studied. We examined articles in biogeography and found that most of the influence is not cited, specific types of articles that are influential are cited while other types of that also are influential are not cited, and work that is "uncited" and "seldom cited" is used extensively. As a result, evaluative citation analysis should take uncited work into account.
