At the occasion of the completion of the 25th volume of Scientometrices, we present a combined bibliometric and social network analysis of this journal.  In more than one respect, Scientometrics displays the characteristics of a social science journal.  Its Price Index amounts to 43.0 percent, and is remarkably stable over time.  The majority of the published items in Scientometrics has been written by a single author.  Moreover, the network of co-authorships is highly fragmented:  most authors cooperate with no more than one or two colleagues.  Both the citation networks of the authors and the network of title words indicate that the field is nonetheless highly cohesive.  In this sense, a specific identity seems to have developed, indeed.  Some indications concerning the character of this identity are discussed.
