This paper describes the construction of improved informetric models of individual scientific and technological areas on the basis of individual co-citation clusters.  The developed methodology of replenishment of research front with accidentally absent papers describes more completely the model.  The simple method of cluster ''dynamisation'' is proposed for the study of evolution of a research area.  The transition under consideration from co-citation clusters to lexical maps of papers and patents allows to monitor the relationship between R and D in a given technological area.  Pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) as modern chemical engineering, is given as an example.
