We present the application of our knowledge visualization tool, VxInsight(R), to enable domain analysis for science and technology management within the enterprise. Data mining from sources of bibliographic information is used to define subsets of information relevant to a technology domain. Relationships between the individual objects (e.g., articles) are identified using citations, descriptive terms, or textual similarities. Objects are then clustered using a force-directed placement algorithm to produce a terrain view of the many thousands of objects. A variety of features that allow exploration and manipulation of the landscapes and that give detail on demand, enable quick and powerful analysis of the resulting landscapes. Examples of domain analyses used in S&T management at Sandia are given.
