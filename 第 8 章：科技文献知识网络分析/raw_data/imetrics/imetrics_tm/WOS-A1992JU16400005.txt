As in many other countries interlibrary lending (ILL) statistics were not systematically collected in Belgium until the seventies. Even today they give not always a complete coverage of the ILL situation in Belgium (an estimated 200.000 requests per year). However, electronic document ordering systems will change the present situation. They can be used to measure the performance of ILL, to improve its quality, to assess weaknesses in the ILL-system, to collect statistical data and to act as a clearinghouse for ILL billing.
