Comparative study of knowledge management (KM) promises to lead to more effective knowledge use in all cultural environments. This pilot study compares KM priorities, needs, tools, and administrative structure components in large Chinese and American universities. General KM theory and literature related to KM in higher education are analyzed to develop the four components of the study. Comparative differences in KM practice at large Chinese and American universities are analyzed for each component. A correlation matrix reveals statistically significant co-variation among all but one of the study components. Four conclusions related to comparative KM and suggestions for future research are presented.
