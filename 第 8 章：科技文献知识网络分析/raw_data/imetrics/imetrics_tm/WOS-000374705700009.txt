With the incorporation of universities' third mission into their traditional teaching and academic research activities, there has been a burgeoning literature on how the third mission influences universities' academic research, though there is little research on its impact on universities' traditional mission-teaching. This study thus intends to strengthen our understanding of the relationships among universities' three missions by examining the relationship between university and industry collaboration and university teaching performance. Thanks to a unique combined dataset from 61 universities from 2009 to 2013, empirical results indicate that there are distinct effects of collaboration channels on teaching performance. Specifically, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between academic commercialization and teaching performance, while there is a U-shaped relationship between academic engagement and teaching performance. Academic commercialization and engagement yield a combined positive effect on teaching.
