The National Citation Report (NCR) is an integrated citation file supplied by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), of an individual country's articles in science and social sciences. Our experience with the NCR database for Mexico suggests that this is an important addition to the tools available for carrying out bibliometric analysis of research performance. However, in order to generate reliable and accurate indicators using these datafiles we recommend that these be handled by specialists well acquainted with the ISI information products and with the scientific setup of the country concerned.
