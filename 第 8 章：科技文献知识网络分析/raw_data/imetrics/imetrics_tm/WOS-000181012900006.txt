A two-level hierarchic system of fields and subfields of the sciences, social sciences and arts & humanities is proposed. The system was specifically designed for scientometric (evaluation) purposes with the ultimate goal of classifying every single document into a well-defined category. This goal was achieved using a three-step iterative process. The basic concepts and some preliminary results are presented.
