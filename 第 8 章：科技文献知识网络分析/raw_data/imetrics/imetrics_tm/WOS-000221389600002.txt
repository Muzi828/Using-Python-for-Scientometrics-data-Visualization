The steady state solution of differential equations of periodical publication process is deduced, and based on this, the indicator of periodical publication delay, which reflects the degree of information ageing in editorial board of a periodical, is established. The indicator is proved to be the sum of two items: the pure publication delay, which reflects the editing rapidity of a periodical, and the ratio of deposited contribution quantity to the publishing quantity in one year, which reflects the waiting period of adopted papers deposited in editorial board. As a demonstration, the delay indicators of seven periodicals are calculated. Finally, the application of this indicator is discussed.
