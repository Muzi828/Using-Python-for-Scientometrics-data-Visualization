The single publication H-index of Schubert is applied to the papers in the Hirsch-core of a researcher, journal or topic. Four practical examples are given and regularities are explained: the regression line of the single publication H-index of the ranked papers in the Hirsch-core is decreasing. We propose two measures of indirect citation impact: the average of the single publication H-indices of the papers in the Hirsch-core and the H-index of these single publication H-indices, defined as the indirect H-index. Formulae for these indirect citation impact measures are given in the Lotkaian context.
