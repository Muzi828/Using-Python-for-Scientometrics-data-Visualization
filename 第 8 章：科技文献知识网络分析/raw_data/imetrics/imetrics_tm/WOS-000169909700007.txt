The purpose of this paper is to apply concepts of the diffusion of innovations research in the study of the international diffusion of a formerly national scientific journal, Annales Zoologici Fennici. The study was conducted using bibliometric methodology. The diffusion of the journal was described through citations of the journal and through the development of the national distribution of its contributors. The compatibility of the journal as well as the decrease of complexity were found to have an influence on diffusion. Bibliometric methods were able to represent the international diffusion of a scientific journal.
