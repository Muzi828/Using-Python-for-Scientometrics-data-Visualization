This paper presents a selection of results of a comprehensive quantitative, research literature-based study of Dutch energy research. The primary goal of this paper is to provide an overview of what bibliometric data from ISI and non-ISI databases may offer to describe the state of affairs in a scientific field. It illustrates the added value of combining bibliometric indicators of publication output, international visibility, international co-operation, and interdisciplinarity in a study of nuclear energy research in the 1980's when its budget decreased dramatically.
