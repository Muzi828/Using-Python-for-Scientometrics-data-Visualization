The measurement of the research output of the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) is problematic, due to the multi-product nature of their teaching and research activities. This study analyses the difficulties related to the measurement of the research output of the HEI and proposes a simple overall indicator which incorporates quantitative and qualitative aspects to permit the decomposition of the influence of the two factors. On the basis of this indicator homogeneous comparisons are made of the relative research output of the countries of the European Union and its evolution during the period 1996-2010.
