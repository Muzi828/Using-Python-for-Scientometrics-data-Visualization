The relationship between science and technology is an important issue, as science-based technologies play a key role in modern economies. The exploration of the science-technology interface can be effectively supported by quantitative indicators, in particular patents of scientific institutions, publications of industrial enterprises, and scientific; references in patent search reports. The most promising approach is the parallel observation of patents and publications in order to analyse the dynamics of the interaction of science and technology and the professional move of academic and industrial researchers between institutions.
