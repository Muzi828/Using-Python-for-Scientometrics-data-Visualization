The paper presents the dynamics of the strategic management scientific community network during knowledge creation and dissemination through the Strategic Management Journal from 1980 to 2009. The paper describes the evolution of the participant countries' position within the network structure. We present the different stages that the network goes through, the vertices' transformation into nodes and hubs, and the statistical significance level of cooperation between the country in the core position and the countries in the semi-periphery and periphery positions during their evolution and growth.
