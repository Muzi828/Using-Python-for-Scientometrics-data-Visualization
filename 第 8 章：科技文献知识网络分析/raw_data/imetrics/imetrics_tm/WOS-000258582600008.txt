This study compares the United States of America and Korea's cases of national information infrastructure (NII) development, focusing on the role of the governments in the development of their NIIs and on the realization of the next generation of information infrastructure vision. The important similarities and differences can be seen by comparison on sociotechnical dimensions: government function, histories, visions, policy design, implementation plans, and realities and prospects. Findings show different patterns of NII development, providing insights for the next generation of NIIs. This study provides a prospect towards future information infrastructure needs in the context of dynamic sociotechnical changes.
