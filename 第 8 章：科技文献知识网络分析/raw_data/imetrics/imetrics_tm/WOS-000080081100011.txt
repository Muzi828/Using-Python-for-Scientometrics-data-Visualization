This paper addresses the relation between developments in scientific communication and research. The developments in scientific communication are related to developments brought about by opportunities provided by the development and wide-scale introduction of modern information and communication technology. However, this paper does not focus on technological developments, but rather discusses how these new developments in scientific communication enable developments in research and research policy, and vice versa. The role of scientometrics and bibliometrics in this context is briefly discussed.
