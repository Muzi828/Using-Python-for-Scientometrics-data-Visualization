This study investigates interactive video retrieval. The basis for this study is that user- and search task-centric research in video information retrieval can assist efforts for developing effective user interfaces and help complement the existing corpus of video retrieval research by providing evidence for the benefits of evaluating systems using such an approach. Accordingly, the results were collected and analyzed from the perspective of certain users and search tasks (i.e., information needs). The methodology of this study employed specially designed interactive search experiments to examine a number of different factors in a video retrieval context, including those that correspond to search tasks of a particular domain, interface features and functions, system effectiveness, and user interactions. The results indicated that the use and effectiveness of certain interface features and functions were dependent on the type of search task, while others were more consistent across the full experiment. Also included is a review of prior research pertaining to visual search tasks, systems development, and user interaction. ViewFinder, the prototype system used to carry out the interactive search experiments of this study, is fully described.
