The frequency distribution of research papers and patents produced by men and women scientists working at CSIR, India, is tested against the distribution function of the       inverse power type (general or square). A K-S test and a t-test were applied to measure the conformity to the inverse power relationship. For both sexes the distribution of research papers took a bimodal shape and the entire data set did not follow an inverse power function. The male and female CSIR population of authors were divided into two groups, one comprising those researchers (50% of authors) who have written up to 10 articles, the other those scientists with 11 or more research papers. The first conform to a flat productivity distribution, whilst the second were well described by an inverse square power relationship. The distribution of patents did not show signs of the presence of two distinct sections of the distribution; however only the male-data fitted the inverse power relationship of the square type. It was also found that the proportion of less productive scientists was slightly greater for men than for women. Some preliminary ideas based on the characteristics of the data and on Indian cultural heritage, were discussed in order to explain some of the results here delineated.
