We analyze the data about works (papers, books) from the time period 1990-2010 that are collected in Zentralblatt MATH database. The data were converted into four 2-mode networks (works x authors, works x journals, works x keywords and works x mathematical subject classifications) and into a partition of works by publication year. The networks were analyzed using Pajek-a program for analysis and visualization of large networks. We explore the distributions of some properties of works and the collaborations among mathematicians. We also take a closer look at the characteristics of the field of graph theory as were realized with the publications.
