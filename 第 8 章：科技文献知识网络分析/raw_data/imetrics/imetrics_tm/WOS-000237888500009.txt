In order to easily see the citation patterns of a journal or subject area it is very useful to use a graphical diagram to visualize all the connections between journals. Using data derived from the Journal Citation Reports, this study investigates the visualization of citation patterns for three Canadian journals in three different subject areas: library and information science, psychology and mathematics.
