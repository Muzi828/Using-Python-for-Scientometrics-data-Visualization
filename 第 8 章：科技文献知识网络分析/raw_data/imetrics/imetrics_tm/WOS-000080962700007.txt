Making use of scientometric techniques, the paper attempts to assess the performance of Indian organic chemistry research during the 70s and 80s. Identifies the significant work and its impact using mainstream connectivity, surrogate measures of quality and relative impact indicators. It is observed that the organic chemistry research performed in India during the later period (80s) has improved slightly as compared to the previous period (70s).
