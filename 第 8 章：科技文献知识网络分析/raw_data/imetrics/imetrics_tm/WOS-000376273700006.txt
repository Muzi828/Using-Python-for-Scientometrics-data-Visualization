This article examines the extent to which existing network centrality measures can be used (1) as filters to identify a set of papers to start reading within a journal and (2) as article-level metrics to identify the relative importance of a paper within a journal. We represent a dataset of published papers in the Public Library of Science (PLOS) via a co-citation network and compute three established centrality metrics for each paper in the network: closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector. Our results show that the network of papers in a journal is scale-free and that eigenvector centrality (1) is an effective filter and article-level metric and (2) correlates well with citation counts within a given journal. However, closeness centrality is a poor filter because articles fit within a small range of citations. We also show that betweenness centrality is a poor filter for journals with a narrow focus and a good filter for multidisciplinary journals where communities of papers can be identified.
