The scientific production of researchers from the Republic of Croatia, consisting of the published papers with addresses of the institutions from Croatia only, was analyzed for the period 1990-1992, covering 2047 SCI, SSCI, and A&HCI registered papers. The source index of SCI has registered 1912 (92.50% of total number of published articles) papers, SSCI 118 (5,71%), and A&HCI 37 (1.79%) papers, respectively. The papers were published in more than 700 different journals, covering 122 scientific subfields. The most frequently used journals are the national Periodicum Biologorum, Croatica Chemica Acta and Collegium Antropologicum with 236 published papers or 11.5%. The largest number of papers have been published in scientific subfields: Biology (146 papers), Chemistry (107), and Physics of Condensed Matter (102). The average paper was published by 3.57 researchers, but subfields of Nuclear Physics (7.40 authors per paper), Immunology (5.67), and Hematology (5.60) were with the highest authorship. The partial contributions of institutions were also determined, and the most productive were Ruder Boskovic Institute with 645.0, the Faculty of Medicine with 396.7, and the Faculty of Science and Mathematics with 201.7 published papers, respectively. The average quality of the used journals were estimated; Institute of Physics, Ruder Boskovic Institute, and the Faculty of Science and Mathematics published their papers in journals with bigger impact factor (higher quality) than average institutions. Publications were divided by the type of papers, most frequent being articles (1778 publications, 86.85%), notes (117, 5.71%) and letters (56, 2.74%), respectively. Scientific subfield distribution of papers published by the most productive institutions were also analyzed.
