We propose a novel yet practical method capturing an individual's research or innovation performance by the shape centroids of the h-core and h-tail areas of its publications or patents. A large number of individuals' relative performance with respect to their h-cores and h-tails can be simultaneously positioned and conveniently observed in two-dimensional coordinate systems. Two approaches are further proposed to the utilization of the two-dimensional distribution of shape centroids. The first approach specifically determines, within a group of individuals, those outperforming or being outperformed by a target individual. The second approach provides a quick qualitative categorization of the individuals so that the nature of their performance is revealed. Using patent assignees as an illustrative case, the approaches are tested with empirical patent assignee data. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
