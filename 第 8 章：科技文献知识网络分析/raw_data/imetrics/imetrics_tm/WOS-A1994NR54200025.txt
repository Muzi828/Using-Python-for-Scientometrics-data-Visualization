Detecting homogeneous areas in research networks is a very common feature of bibliometric analysis, either for academic or policy purposes. The method presented here combines structural analysis and trend detection, by operating on a ''thick-slice'' of time, starting from co-citation or co-word analysis (applications of either type have already been carried on). Significance of ''trend'' of clusters is partially addressed, through an analysis of publication delays. Examples are given on a co-citation analysis in the field of astrophysics (1986-1989).
