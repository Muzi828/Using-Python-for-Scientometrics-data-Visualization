Once taken for granted as morally legitimate, legal protection of intellectual property rights have come under fire in the last 30 years as new technologies have evolved and severed the link between expression of ideas and such traditional material-based media as books and magazines.

This essay provides an overview and assessment of the arguments and counterarguments on the issue of whether intellectual property should be legally protected.
