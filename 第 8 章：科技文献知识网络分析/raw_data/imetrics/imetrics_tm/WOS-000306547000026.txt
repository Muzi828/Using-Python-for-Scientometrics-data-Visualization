J.K. Vanclay's article is a bold attempt to review recent works on the journal impact factor (JIF) and to call for alternative certifications of journals. The too broad scope did not allow the author to fulfill all his purposes. Attempting after many others to organize the various forms of criticism, with targets often broader than the JIF, we shall try to comment on a few points. This will hopefully enable us to infer in which cases the JIF is an angel, a devil, or a scapegoat. We shall also expand on a crucial question that Vanclay could not really develop in the reduced article format: the field-normalization. After a short recall on classical cited-side or ex post normalization and of the powerful influence measures, we will devote some attention to the novel way of citing-side or ex ante normalization, not only for its own interest, but because it directly proceeds from the disassembling of the JIF clockwork.
