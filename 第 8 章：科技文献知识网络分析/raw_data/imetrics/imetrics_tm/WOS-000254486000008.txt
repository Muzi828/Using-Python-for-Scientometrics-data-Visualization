This paper presents a study of possible changes in patterns of document types in economics journals since the mid-1980s. Furthermore, the study includes an analysis of a possible relation between the profile of a journal concerning composition of document types and factors such as place of publication and JIF. The results provide little evidence that the journal editors have succeeded in manipulating the distribution of document types. Furthermore, there is little support for the hypothesis that journal editors decrease the number of publications included in the calculation of JIF or for that matter for the hypothesis that journal editors increase the number of publications not included in the calculation of JIF. The results of the analyses show that there is a clear distinction of journals based on place of publication and JLF.
