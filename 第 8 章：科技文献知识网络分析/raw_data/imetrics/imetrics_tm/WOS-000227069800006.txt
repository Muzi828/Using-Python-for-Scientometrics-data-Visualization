Using the method of bibliometrics, a 1999-2002 biochemistry and molecular biology database was constructed for China from the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-Expanded). Based on this database, the author quantitatively analyzed the current research activity in biochemistry and molecular biology in China. Results show that almost half the publications were published in Chinese journals. The percentage of articles published by Chinese authors in the total articles from the world is increasing. The number of articles published in high influence journals is continuously increasing. The research outputs are mainly located in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. The sites of the China Science Academy and National Universities are the important locations for these studies. The collaboration rate of Chinese output is low as compared to results from other countries. USA and Japan are the main international collaborating countries.
