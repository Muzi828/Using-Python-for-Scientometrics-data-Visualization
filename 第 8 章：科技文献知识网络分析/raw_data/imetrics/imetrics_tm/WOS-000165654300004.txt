This paper analyses the research activity conducted by Puerto Rican scientists in science and technology in the period 1990 to 1998. The Science Citation Index (SCI) database was used to analyse scientific production by geographic area, type of institution, document typology, language coverage, visibility of publications, subjects addressed and collaboration between local and international authors and institutions. Scientific production was observed to nearly double over the period studied and found to be concentrated in the academic sector, primarily in the city of San Juan, specifically in the University of Puerto Rico's Rio Piedras, Medical Sciences and Mayaguez campuses. Puerto Rican scientific production in the period studied was greater than in any other Caribbean country and the sixth largest in all of Latin America. Papers are mainly published in highly visible journals and scientific articles are the vehicle most commonly used to reach the scientific community. Go-operation indices between authors and institutions are high and the principal areas in which research is published are Medicine, Chemistry, Life Sciences and Physics.
