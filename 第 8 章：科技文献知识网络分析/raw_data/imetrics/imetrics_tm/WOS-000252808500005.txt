Significant discrepancies were found in the ratio and relative impact of the journal papers of several scientific fields of some Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries compared to the European Community member states, the US and Japan (EUJ countries). A new indicator, characterizing the Mean Structural Difference of scientific fields between countries has been introduced and calculated for CEE countries. For EUJ countries correlation between the GDP and number of publications of a given year proved to be non-significant. Longitudinal studies showed, however, significant correlations between the yearly values of GDP and number of papers published. Studying data referring to consecutive time periods revealed that there is no direct relationship between the GDP and information production of countries. It may be assumed that grants for R&D do not actually depend on real needs, but the fact is that rich countries can afford to spend more whilst poor countries only less money on scientific research.
