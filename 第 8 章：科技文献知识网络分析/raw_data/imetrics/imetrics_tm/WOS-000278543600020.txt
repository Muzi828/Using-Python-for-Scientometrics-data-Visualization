In this study direct citations are weighted with shared references and co-citations in an attempt to decompose a citation network of articles on the subject of library and information science. The resulting maps have much in common with author co-citation maps that have been previously presented. However, using direct citations yields somewhat more detail in terms of detecting sub-domains. Reducing the network down to the strongest links of each article yielded the best results in terms of a high number of clusters, each with a substantial number of articles similar in content.
