Although, women's contribution to science is crucial to social development, gender difference has been for a long time affecting the quantity and quality of scholarly activity. In spite of some improvements, women are still suffering from gender gap and biases in science world. Using a scientometric method with a comparative approach, the present communication aims to study women performance in Nano Science & Technology in terms of their scientific productivity and impact and to contrast them to their male counterparts. The significance of the study relies on the importance of a balanced development of human society in general and in different scientific milieus in specific. According to the research results, although female Nano-researchers are scarce in number, they equally perform in terms of scientific productions and impacts. That may imply gender egalitarianism in the field.
