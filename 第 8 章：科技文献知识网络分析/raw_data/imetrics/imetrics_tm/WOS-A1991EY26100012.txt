The science-related material published in newspapers can be analysed to provide insight into the biases and techniques involved in transferring knowledge from the science community to the general public. A part of such studies can be carried out in quantitative terms. Three such quantitative approaches are illustrated here: (1) measurement of space devoted to science; (2) derivation of readability indices; (3) content analysis.
