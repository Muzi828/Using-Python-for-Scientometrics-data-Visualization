An, innovator's personality along with the perceived attributes of an innovation predicts the rate of diffusion. The current study focuses on the personality factors that determine the likelihood of adoption of a technological innovation. To that end, the study distinguishes between global innovativeness and context-specific innovativeness. An information processing model was tested where technological innovativeness was purported to be indirectly influenced by an individual's global innovativeness, through its impact on communication and media use behaviors. The structural model was tested on two separate technology clusters, and partial support was found for linking sophistication in information search, and prior technology ownership to technological innovativeness.
