In this article, the use of a new term extraction method for query expansion (QE) in text retrieval is investigated. The new method expands the initial query with a structured representation made of weighted word pairs (WWP) extracted from a set of training documents (relevance feedback). Standard text retrieval systems can handle a WWP structure through custom Boolean weighted models. We experimented with both the explicit and pseudorelevance feedback schemas and compared the proposed term extraction method with others in the literature, such as KLD and RM3. Evaluations have been conducted on a number of test collections (Text REtrivel Conference [TREC]-6, -7, -8, -9, and -10). Results demonstrated that the QE method based on this new structure outperforms the baseline.
