Time dependencies of Bradford distributions are investigated for 19th-century mathematics and for 20th-century logic. To facilitate comparisons, for the representation of empirical Bradford distributions '' Pareto's law '' and Lorenz diagrams are used. It is shown that the character of a Bradford distribution (including the '' core zone '' and the '' Groos droop '') depends on the stage in the development of a scientific field and that it varies with the time-span considered.
