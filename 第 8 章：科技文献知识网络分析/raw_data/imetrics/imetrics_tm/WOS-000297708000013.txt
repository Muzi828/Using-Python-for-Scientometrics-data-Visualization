The era of open and sustainable innovation has opened and requested new kinds of human resources (HRs) development at Korean universities. Typical academic and vocational education at universities does not effectively work in the age of technological convergence and open innovation. Knowledge and skills for Green growth and rapid technological innovation demand very skilful, broad, and complex competencies of HRs. Competencies for green growth and disruptive innovation are outlined and various methods to increase competencies at Korean universities are suggested in this study. This study explores the kinds of competencies for future society and suggests how university can contribute to cultivate talents for HRs with multi-functional and high competencies. The author takes a sketch of competence and skill structure in Korea, summarized in value chain of competencies among HRs with high competencies, HRs with medium competencies, and HRs with low competencies. Particularly the author addresses innovation oriented fields such as engineering and chemistry/pharmaceuticals, therefore, the picture can be different from typical manufacturing sectors such as automobile and shipbuilding. However, the manufacturing fields are also progressing into innovation centred sectors. And then the author explores the flow of each HRs according to levels and fields and how they affect Korean innovation system.
