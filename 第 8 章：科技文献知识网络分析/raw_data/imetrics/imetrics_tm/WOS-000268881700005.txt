There is a growing literature measuring research excellence in economics. The h-index is noteworthy in combining quantity and research quality in a single measure of researcher excellence, and its ability to be extended to measure the quantity and quality of the researchers in a department. We extend the use of the first successive h-index further to measure the quality of graduate education, specifically excellence in research supervision, based on publication and citation data for individual researchers ascribed to their graduate supervisors.
