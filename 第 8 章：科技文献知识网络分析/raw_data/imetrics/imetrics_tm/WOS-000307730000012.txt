Mixed methods research (MMR) has been described as the third research paradigm that combines qualitative and quantitative research methods. The mixing of research methods requires an epistemological framework that embraces the reality uncovered by different research methods. Three formal ontological categories are introduced for deconstructing the polarized view of reality in objectivism and relativism and for differentiating the nature and characteristics of objective, subjective, and normative validity claims as well as the conditions for justifying objectivity in social research. The characterization of information as objective, subjective, and normative-evaluative simultaneously demands the study of conditions of information-related phenomena that may call for mixed methods research in library and information science.
