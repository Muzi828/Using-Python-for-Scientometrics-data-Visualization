This article estimates the first constant quality price index for Internet domain names. The suggested index provides a benchmark for domain name traders and investors looking for information on price trends, historical returns, and the fundamental risk of Internet domain names. The index increases transparency in the market for this newly emerged asset class. Acointegration analysis shows that domain registrations and resale prices form a long-run equilibrium and indicates supply constraints in domain space. This study explores a large data set of domain sales spanning the years 2006 to 2013. Differences in the quality of individual domain names are controlled for in hedonic repeat sales regressions.
