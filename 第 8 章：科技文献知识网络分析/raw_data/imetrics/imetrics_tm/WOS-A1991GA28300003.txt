This paper outlines the results of a recent survey of the UK contract research market, estimated at 900 MECU (1988/89).  Most UK contract research organization (CROs) undertake a small but significant amount of overseas contract R & D (both for other Member States and elsewhere), and see this increasing as the Single European Market (SEM) develops.  Most UK CROs have participated in EC R & D programmes and viewed involvement as a, generally, positive experience.  UK Industrial customers of contract R & D, although more UK orientated, also believe the SEM will increase the amount of contracting from Member States.  Industrial companies involved in EC R & D programmes also noted benefits from involvement.  Both UK CROs and the industrial customer organizations saw the SEM and the associated Europeanization process as enhancing commercial contacts with organizations in other Member States.
