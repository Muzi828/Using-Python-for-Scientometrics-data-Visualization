This paper studies how missing data in the PageRank algorithm influences the result of papers ranking and proposes PrestigeRank algorithm on that basis. We make use of PrestigeRank to give the ranking of all papers in physics in the Chinese Scientific and Technology Papers and Citation Database (CSTPCD) published between 2004 and 2006. We compared PrestigeRank result with PageRank and citation ranking. We found PrestigeRank is significantly correlated with PageRank and citation counts. We also used paper citation networks to rank journals, and compared the result with that of journal citation networks. We proposed PR(sum), PR(ave), and compared both of them with citation counts and impact factor. It indicates PR(sum), PR(ave) can reflect journal's authority favorably. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages, application scope and application prospects of PrestigeRank in the evaluation of papers and journals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
