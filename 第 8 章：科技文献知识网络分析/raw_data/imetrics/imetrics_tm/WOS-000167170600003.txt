We present different methods of data collection fi om the Web for informetric purposes. For each method, some studies utilizing it are reviewed, and advantages and shortcomings of each technique are discussed. The paper emphasizes that data collection must be carried out with great care. Since the Web changes constantly, the findings of any study are valid only in the time frame in which it was carried out, and are dependent on the quality of the data collection tools, which are usually not under the control of the researcher. At the current time, the quality and the reliability of most of the available search tools are not satisfactory, thus informetric analyses of the Web mainly serve as demonstrations of the applicability of informetric methods to this medium, and not as a means for obtaining definite conclusions. A possible solution is for the scientific world to develop its own search and data collection tools.
