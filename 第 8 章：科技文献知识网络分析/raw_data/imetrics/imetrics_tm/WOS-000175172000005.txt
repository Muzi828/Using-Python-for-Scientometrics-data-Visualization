The authorship and citation patterns in the journal titled Management Science (MS) are analysed. The purpose of the analysis is to examine the competitive relation of MS with OR (operational research or operations research). The analysis is focused on the use of mathematical methods, because MS entered the management research area by using mathematical methods developed by OR and because the use of mathematical methods in real management is facing difficulties. The relationship of MS with information systems (IS) and organisation research (Org) is analysed in regard to the competition of MS with OR. The analysis reveals the intermediate character of MS; that is, MS is less prone to mathematical methods and is more inclined towards IS and Org than OR is.
