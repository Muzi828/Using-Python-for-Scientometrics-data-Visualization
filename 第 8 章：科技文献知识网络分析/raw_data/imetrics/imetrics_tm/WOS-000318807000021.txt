As all databases, the bibliometric ones (e.g. Scopus, Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar) are not exempt from errors, such as missing or wrong records, which may obviously affect publication/citation statistics and-more in general-the resulting bibliometric indicators. This paper tries to answer to the question "What is the effect of database uncertainty on the evaluation of the h-index?", breaking the paradigm of deterministic database analysis and treating responses to database queries as random variables. Precisely an informetric model of the h-index is used to quantify the variability of this indicator with respect to the variability stemming from errors in database records. Some preliminary results are presented and discussed.
