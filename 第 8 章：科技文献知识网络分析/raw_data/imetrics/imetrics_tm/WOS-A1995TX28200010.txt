Toshiba, a broadly-based electric/electronics manufacturer, operates diversified businesses. A sophisticated research and technology management system supports those businesses based on a research and technology development (RTD) organization consisting of three layers: corporate, business group, and divisional laboratories. Evaluation of RTD projects is varied in accordance with their characteristics. To promote future inter-divisional business, the Corporate Incentive Program (CIP) funds corporate projects which are authorized and evaluated by the Corporate Technology Committee (CTC). In parallel, under the Corporate Strategic Program (CSP), committees monitor and evaluate specific, rapidly-advancing technologies so as to promote early acquisition and diffusion. Additionally, transnational strategic alliances (TSAs) are promoted on the basis of their merits and in accordance with Toshiba's corporate philosophy of Competition, Cooperation and Complementarity (CC&C). The corporate Research and Development Center (RDC) conducts pre- and intermediate evaluations as part of the Long- and Middle-range Planning every year. When new technologies are transferred to the business divisions, post-evaluation starts and future monetary impacts are estimated; subsequently actual monetary contributions are monitored annually. Another style of pre-evaluation can be observed at the RDC in the Exploratory Programs by the Young (EPY). First, some actual cases at Toshiba are introduced. Next, discussion is extended to the evaluation framework, the corporate technology model and RTD productivity Also noted is the importance of recognizing that the consumer is the ultimate evaluator and that evaluation-quality is improved by feedback from the market. Concept creation and target clarification must come first; only then does the evaluation make sense.
