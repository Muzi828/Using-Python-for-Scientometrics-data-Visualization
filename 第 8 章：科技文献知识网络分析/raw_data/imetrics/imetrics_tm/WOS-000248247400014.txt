The h-index (Hirsch, 2005) is robust, remaining relatively unaffected by errors in the long tails of the citations-rank distribution, such as typographic errors that shortchange frequently cited articles and create bogus additional records. This robustness, and the ease with which h-indices can be verified, support the use of a Hirschtype index over alternatives such as the journal impact factor. These merits of the h-index apply both to individuals and to journals.
