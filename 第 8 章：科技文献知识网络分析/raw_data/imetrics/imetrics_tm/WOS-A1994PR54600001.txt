Communication is essential in scientific research. Scientific papers represent the main information sources in natural sciences. A model of the Manifested Communication through Publications is introduced which makes it possible to calculate indicators characteristic of bilateral information processes. Bilateral Coupling is for example the total number of non-zero cross elements in the information matrix containing references to each other's papers of the two teams.
