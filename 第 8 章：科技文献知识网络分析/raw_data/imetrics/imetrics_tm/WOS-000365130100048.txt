Recently, Scientometrics has published a paper titled "Is there bias in editorial choice? Yes" (Moustafa 2015) in which some comments are given on our published paper in Nature titled "Is there fame bias in editorial choice?" (Mahian et al. 2015). Unfortunately, the author of above mentioned paper and many other readers might misunderstand the main aim of our correspondence. Here, we try to give some explanations to clarify the main goal of analysis presented in the paper.
