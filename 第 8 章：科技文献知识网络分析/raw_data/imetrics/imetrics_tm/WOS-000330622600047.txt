A new quantitative method is introduced to analyze the collaboration among different organizations. The method defines the collaboration score based on the number of people involved in collaboration, and then the collaboration strength is obtained by summing up the collaboration scores with this method. We choose "Project 985" universities, which represent the top universities in China, as an example to study the collaboration network, strength in leading collaboration and strength in participating collaboration. Results based on Scopus show some characteristics of such collaboration and verify the feasibility of the new approach.
