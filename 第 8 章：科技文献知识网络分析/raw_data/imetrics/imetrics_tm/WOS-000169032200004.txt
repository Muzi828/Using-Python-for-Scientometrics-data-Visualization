A visual term discrimination value analysis method is introduced using a document density space within a distance-angle-based visual information retrieval environment. The term discrimination capacity is analyzed using the comparison of the distance and angle-based visual representations with and without a specified term, thereby allowing the user to see the impact of the term on individual documents within the density space. Next, the concept of a "term density space" is introduced for term discrimination analysis. Using this concept, a term discrimination capacity for distinguishing one term from others in the space can also be visualized within the visual space, Applications of these methods facilitate more effective assignment of term weights to index terms within documents and may assist searchers in the selection of search terms.
