This study examines the effect of international collaboration of Slovenian authors and the status of journals where papers are published (as determined by their impact factors) on the impact of papers as measured by the number of citations papers receive. Research programme groups working in Slovenia in the 2004-2008 period in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, biotechnology, and medical science were used for analyses. The results of the analyses show that the effects of the two factors differ among the fields. We discuss possible reasons for this, including the possibility that differences are the result of Slovenia's science policy.
