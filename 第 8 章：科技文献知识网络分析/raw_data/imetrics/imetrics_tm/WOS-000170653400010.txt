Recent advances in the power and capabilities of personal computers have brought the algorithms and representational methods of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to the desktop. Information that has relationships between elements may be represented spatially, especially if some distance metric can be brought to bear. This paper discusses information cartography, the use of spatial methods for the display of non-Geographic data.
