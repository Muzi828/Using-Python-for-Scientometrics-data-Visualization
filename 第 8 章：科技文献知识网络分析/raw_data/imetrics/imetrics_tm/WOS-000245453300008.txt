The applicability of Hirsch's h index (Hirsch, 2005) for evaluating scientific research in Spain has been investigated. A series of derivative indexes that take into account: i) the overall low scientific production in Spain before the' 80s; ii) differences among areas due to size (overall number of citations for publications in a given area); and iii) the number of authors, are suggested. Their applicability has been tested for two different areas in the Biological Sciences. The proposed set of indexes accurately summarizes both the success and evolution of scientists' careers in Spain, and it may be useful in the evaluation of other not well established national scientific research systems.
