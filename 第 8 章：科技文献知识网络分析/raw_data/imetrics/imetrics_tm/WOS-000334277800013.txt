A scientometric analysis of the BabeAY-Bolyai University in Romania is provided, highlighting the strong and the weak points with respect to a range of leading international universities and referencing to some extent to nation-wide data from several countries. Taken into account are such items as total number of publications, analyses per subject area or per research field, number of citations, types of publications, Hirsch indexes, and books. Internationally, chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science, religion, area studies, geology, paleontology, and public administration are identified as the most active areas. Nationally, a number of additional strong points are identified, such as psychology, history, and environmental sciences. The percentage of researchers with reasonably high activity (e.g., at least similar to one publication per year as indexed in major databases) is relatively low (similar to 10 %), and the percentage with reasonably high international competitiveness (based on citation counts, number of publications, books indexed in international libraries) is at only similar to 2 %. The decisive factor controlling an exponential increase in publications since similar to 2000-2004 appears to have been a conservatively managed exponential increase of the national GDP and implicitly of the research budgets.
