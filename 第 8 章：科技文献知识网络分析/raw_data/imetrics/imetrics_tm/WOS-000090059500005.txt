The paper investigates Indian organic chemistry research activity during 1971-1989 using Chemical Abstracts. It attempts at quantification of national contribution to world efforts, and identify areas of relative strengths and weaknesses. Also models the growth of Indian organic chemistry output to world organic chemistry output as a whole and in sub-fields where the activity index for the world and India are similar.
