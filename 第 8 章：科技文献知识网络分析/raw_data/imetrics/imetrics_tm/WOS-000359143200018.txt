We revisit our recent study [Predicting results of the Research Excellence Framework using departmental h-index, Scientometrics, 2014, 102:2165-2180; <ExternalRef> <RefSource>arXiv:1411.1996</RefSource> <RefTarget Address="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1996" TargetType="URL"/> </ExternalRef>] in which we attempted to predict outcomes of the UK's Research Excellence Framework (REF 2014) using the so-called departmental h-index. Here we report that our predictions failed to anticipate with any accuracy either overall REF outcomes or movements of individual institutions in the rankings relative to their positions in the previous Research Assessment Exercise (RAE 2008).
