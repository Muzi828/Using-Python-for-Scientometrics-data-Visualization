We studied 187 papers published in the journals on astronomy and astrophysics indexed in the Science Citation Index (SCI) for the decade period 1985-1994. These have been the papers that included at least one author listing an address from an institution in Turkey. We found that a great majority of the papers, whether theoretical or observational, went to only very small number (three) of a total set of 34 journals in the area. The distribution of papers by institutions revealed that about three fourths of the papers came from two universities: the Aegean University, and the Middle East Technical University (METU). We also found that the fraction of multiple authored papers has increased appreciably and the number of citations an ''average'' paper received has decreased gradually during the period considered.
