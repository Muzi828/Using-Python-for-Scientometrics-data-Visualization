In this paper we extend earlier work on the role of the personality trait of resistance to change (RTC) in the adoption of digital libraries. We present an integrative study, drawing on a number of research streams, including IT adoption, social psychology, and digital-library acceptance. Using structural equation modeling, we confirm RTC as a direct antecedent of effort expectancy. In addition, we also find that by affecting computer anxiety and result demonstrability, RTC acts as an indirect antecedent to both effort expectancy and performance expectancy, which in turn determine user intention to adopt digital library technology. Implications for research and practice are discussed.
