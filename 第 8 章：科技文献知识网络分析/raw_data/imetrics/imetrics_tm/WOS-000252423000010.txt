Polarity mining provides an in-depth analysis of semantic orientations of text information. Motivated by its success in the area of topic mining, we propose an ontology-supported polarity mining (OSPM) approach. The approach aims to enhance polarity mining with ontology by providing detailed topic-specific information. OSPM was evaluated in the movie review domain using both supervised and unsupervised techniques. Results revealed that OSPM outperformed the baseline method without ontology support. The findings of this study not only advance the state of polarity mining research but also shed light on future research directions.
