The proliferation of digital information resources and electronic databases challenges libraries and demands that libraries develop new mechanisms to facilitate and better inform user selection of electronic databases and search tools. We developed a prototype, Web-based database selection expert system based on reference librarian's database selection strategy. This system allows users to simultaneously search all databases available to identify databases most relevant to their quests using free-text keywords or phrases taken directly from their research topics. This article reports on (1) the initial usability test and evaluation of the Selector-the test design, methodology used, performance results; (2) summary of search query analyses; (3) user satisfaction measures; (4) the use of the findings for further modification of the Selector; and (5) the findings of using randomly selected subjects to perform a usability test with predefined searching scenarios. Future prospects of this research have also been discussed in the article.
