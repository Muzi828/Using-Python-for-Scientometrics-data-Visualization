The h-index is a recent metric that captures a scholar's influence. In the current work, it is used to: (1) obtain the h-index scores of the most productive scholars in the Journal of Consumer Research (JCR), and compare these to other elite scholars (including those of the other three premier marketing journals); (2) demonstrate the relationship between the h-indices and total number of citations of the top JCR producers; (3) examine the h-indices of Ferber winners (best interdisciplinary paper based on a doctoral dissertation published in JCR in a given year) and those having received honorable mentions; (4) explore the relationship between a marketing journal's prestige and the corresponding hindex score of its editor. These varied analyses demonstrate the multitudinous ways in which the h-index can be used when investigating bibliometric phenomena within a given discipline.
