Activities of research institutes of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences were assessed multi-dimensionally. Taking into account goals and tasks of the institutes, weighted scientometric indicators were suggested. The weights of the individual indexes were distributed among the institutes by the values of their indicators. The sum of the individual weighted scores representing special aspects of the total activity yields a General Performance Index (GPI) which, together with a thorough peer review, may be used for distributing grants.
