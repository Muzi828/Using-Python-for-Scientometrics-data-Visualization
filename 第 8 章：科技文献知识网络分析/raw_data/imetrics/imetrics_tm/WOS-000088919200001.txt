We present some features that characterise the mobility and interaction of researchers within a given S&T environment. The variable of interest is the number of research proposals submitted for funding. The model is applied to the case of Colombia and the following results are exhibited: a) a "flux matrix" that characterises the "interactions" as a function of rime between researchers and COLCIENCIAS (national S&T funding agency). Some properties of the matrix are established and a "probability" for a researcher who has previously submitted a proposal to reenter is calculated as a function of time. It is found that this probability is approximately time-independent, at least for the next 7 years after first researcher's appearance; b) patterns of interaction between researchers/institutions and COLCIENCIAS, seen through the number of presented proposals. The interaction assumes the will-known form encountered in these kinds of distributions: a small set of actors (researchers/institutions) is responsible for most of the interaction; c) a temporal pattern for mean researcher's age is established and it is found that by the end of the observed period researchers start to interact in ages that are significantly greater than those observed at the beginning.
