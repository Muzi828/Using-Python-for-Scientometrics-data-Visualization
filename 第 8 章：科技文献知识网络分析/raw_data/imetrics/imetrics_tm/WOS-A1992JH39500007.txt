The theory of autopoiesis, i.e., self-referentiality in the operation of the system, provides us with a production rule for change in the structure of the network. Using information theory, a model system is developed to study the relative likelihood of "dynamic" transitions: various senses of 'irreversibility" ("emergence", and "path dependency) are distinguished. A test for "path dependency" is applied to two sets of empirical data which supposedly reflect historical discontinuities: the budget of the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft, and the citation network among AIDS research related journals. The model for the interaction between self-referential developments and goal-referential boundary conditions is further specified, using the example of technological trajectories and selection environments.
