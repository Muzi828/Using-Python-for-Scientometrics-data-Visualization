Conceptual and data problems make the selection of science and technology indicators difficult. It has also proven hard to link measures of scientific and technological activity with economic development. In this paper, statistically significant results are obtained by regressing one science and technology output indicator: patents granted to residents, with R & D expenditures and the stock of potential scientists and engineers. Statistically significant results are also obtained by regressing the same dependent variable onto population size and income per capita. The econometrically established patterns tend to corroborate previously formulated hypotheses and could be used, it is suggested, for policy analysis and projections.
