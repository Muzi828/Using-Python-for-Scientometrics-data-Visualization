We clarify the content of the article "Impact coverage of the success-index" by Leo Egghe and show that its real contribution is showing that for a Lotkaian system it is possible to determine a threshold value as a function of the system's parameters such that the value of the success-index corresponding to this threshold value is equal to the h-index and similar indices. It is observed that these results do not strictly hold in discrete systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
