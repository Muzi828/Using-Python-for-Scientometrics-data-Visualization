A basic challenge for intelligence and security informatics is exploring the ways in which humans categorize or classify "sensitive" information. Research and practice support the critical nature of categorization frameworks, yet there are a number of different ways humans conceptualize sensitive information. In this paper we review some of the dilemmas associated with classification of sensitive information, present different classification approaches, and then identify alternative propositions related to factors that influence judgments about degree of sensitivity. We conclude with directions for future research.
