The development of methods for the quantification of research impact has taken a variety of forms: the impact of research outputs on other research, through various forms of citation analysis; the impact of research and technology, through patent-derived data; the economic impact of research projects and programs, through a variety of cost-benefit analyses; the impact of research on company performance, where there is no relationship with profit, but a strong positive correlation with sales growth has been established; and calculations of the rates of social return on the investment in research.
However, each of these approaches, which have had varying degrees of success, are being challenged by substantial revision in the understanding of the ways in which research interacts, and contributes to, other human activities. First, advances in the sociology of scientific knowledge have revealed the complex negotiation processes involved in the establishment of research outcomes and their meanings. In this process, citation is little more than a peripheral formalisation. Second, the demonstration of the limitations of neo-classical economics in explaining the role of knowledge in the generation of wealth, and the importance of learning processes, and interaction, in innovation within organisations, has finally overturned the linear model on which so many research impact assessments have been based. A wider examination of the political economy of research evaluation itself reveals the growth of a strong movement towards managerialism, with the application of a variety of mechanisms - foresight, priority setting, research evaluation, research planning - to improve the efficiency of this component of economic activity. However, there are grounds for questioning whether the resulting improved efficiencies have, indeed, improved overall performances. A variety of mechanisms are currently being experimented with in a number of countries which provide both the desired accountability and direction for research, but which rely less on the precision of measures and more on promoting a research environment that is conducive to interaction, invention, and connection.
