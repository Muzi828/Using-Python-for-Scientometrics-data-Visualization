This paper presents the results of an examination of a selection of published European evaluations. The incidence of quantitative and scientometric approaches has been reviewed and an assessment made of their contributory role in each evaluation. The various approaches have been broadly categorised according to the type of data they draw upon, and by the issues they attempt to address. The author analyses such approaches with regard to the degree of success in meeting the objectives of the evaluation. In the light of this some likely future trends are suggested.
