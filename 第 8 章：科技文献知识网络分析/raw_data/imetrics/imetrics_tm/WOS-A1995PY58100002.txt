This paper examines the contribution of Indian universities to the mainstream scientific literature during 1987-1989 along two distinct, but inter-related dimensions of quantity and quality of research output.  The quantity of output is assessed through the number of articles published in journals covered by Science Citation Index, while the quality of output is assessed through the impact factors of journals in which the articles are published.  The impact factors are normalized to eliminate the confounding effects of their covariates, viz. the subject field and the nature of journal.  A number of relative indicators are constructed for inter-field and inter-institution comparisons, viz. publication effectiveness index,1 relative quality index,2 activity index3 and citability index.4  Inter-field comparisons are made at the level of eight macrofields:  Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Earth & Space Sciences, Agriculture, Medical Sciences and Engineering & Technology.  Inter-institution comparisons cover thirty three institutions which had published at least 150 articles in three years.  The structure of correlations of these institutions with eight macrofields is analyzed through correspondence analysis of the matrices of activity and citability profiles.  Correspondence analysis yields a mapping of institutions which reveals the structure of science as determined by the cumulative effect of resource allocation decisions taken in the past for different fields and institutions i.e. the effect of national science policy.
