A quantitative modification to keep the number of published papers invariant under multiple authorship is suggested. In those cases, fractional allocations are attributed to each co-author with a summation equal to one. These allocations are tailored on the basis of each author contribution. It is denoted "Tailor Based Allocations (TBA)" for multiple authorship. Several protocols to TBA are suggested. The choice of a specific TBA may vary from one discipline to another. In addition, TBA is applied to the number of citations of a multiple author paper to have also this number conserved. Each author gets only a specific fraction of the total number of citations according to its fractional paper allocation. The equivalent of the h-index obtained by using TBA is denoted the gh-index. It yields values which differ drastically from those given by the h-index. The gh-index departs also from (h) over bar recently proposed by Hirsh to account for multiple authorship. Contrary to the h-index, the gh-index is a function of the total number of citations of each paper. A highly cited paper allows a better allocation for all co-authors while a less cited paper contributes essentially to one or two of the co-authors. The scheme produces a substantial redistribution of the ranking of scientists in terms of quantitative records. A few illustrations are provided.
