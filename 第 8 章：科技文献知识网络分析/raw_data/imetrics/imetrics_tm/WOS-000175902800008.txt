Developing the probability function to describe rank-size Zipfian phenomena, i.e., a form like P(R = r)similar toc/r(a) (alpha>0) with a rank type random variable R, has been an important problem in scientometrics and informetrics. In this article a new rank-size distribution of Zipf's law is presented and applied to an actual distribution of scientific productivities in Chinese universities.
