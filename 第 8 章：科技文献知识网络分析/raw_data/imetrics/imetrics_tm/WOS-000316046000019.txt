In order to explore the rule of knowledge creation activities at both temporal and spatial scales, this paper makes statistical analysis of the time interval and spatial displacement of consecutive knowledge creation activities of high-yield, low-yield, and ASFP (all the scientists published at least four papers), respectively. The research shows that, for high-yield scientists, the time interval of knowledge creation activities obeys heavy-tailed distribution and embodies bursting features, with both long-time silence and intensive burst of creation activities. The time interval distribution of low-yield scientists is approximate to exponential distribution, and is often randomly and occasionally distributed. For ASFP, the spatial distribution of creation activities also embodies heavy-tailed features, where their activities are intensively confined to a certain knowledge field, and where long-distance exploration across the knowledge fields has also been made in knowledge creation activities.
