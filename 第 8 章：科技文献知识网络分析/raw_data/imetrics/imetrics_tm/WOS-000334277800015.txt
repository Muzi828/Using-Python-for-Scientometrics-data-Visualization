Peer evaluation of research grant applications is a crucial step in the funding decisions of many science funding agencies. Funding bodies take various measures to increase the independence and quality of this process, sometimes leading to difficult combinatorial problems. We propose a novel method based on network flow theory to find assignments of evaluators to grant applications that obey the rules formulated by the Slovak Research and Development Agency.
