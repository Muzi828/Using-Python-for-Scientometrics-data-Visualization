A questionnaire study of 385 eminent Croatian scientists has examined the quantity, patterns and factors of their scientific production in four different scientific fields. The findings confirm the thesis that the contextual influences will be even more expressed within this elite group than within the whole research population. Thus the respondents' scientific productivity much clearly shows the patterns typical for their scientific fields. The initial thesis is also supported by a very differentiated composition and the explanatory power of the productivity predictors in the observed fields. Yet, the scientific and linguistic qualifications, within a narrower predictors' block, and the involvement in the international scientific activity, in a broader one, were the most important productivity factors in most fields.
