Describes a new method of evaluation of scientific output by laboratories engaged in diverse fields of research.  This method helps to evaluate those outputs which are quite recent and not amendable to citation analysis.  For the purpose of analysis, impact factor of journals in which papers are published are considered.  A method for normalisation of impact factor of journals has been described and, normalised impact factors have also been used for the purpose of analysis.  It is found that in such analysis normalised impact factor tends to show better results compared to simple impact factor.  The analysis helps us to generate numerous performance indicators such as average impact factor and normalised impact factor for each laboratory and the research complex such as CSIR as a whole; average impact factor and normalised impact factor for each scientist of a laboratory and the research complex; spectral distribution of papers falling within various ranges of impact factors and normalised impact factors.  By comparing the performances over several years the trend of research activity of each laboratory can also be obtained.
