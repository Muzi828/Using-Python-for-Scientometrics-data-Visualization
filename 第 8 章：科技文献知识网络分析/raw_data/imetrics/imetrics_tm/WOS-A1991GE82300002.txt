This is a statistical analysis of the publishing activity of astronomers worldwide, as measured by the number of papers and monographs published in the period 1969-87. Both the astronomical literature and the number of authors publishing in the field are increasing rapidly. The distribution of productivity among astronomers is followed in time, thus revealing the evolution of research methods and publication strategies in the past 19 years. Fourteen "superproductive" astronomers, who published over 150 papers in 15 years, and the subsample of French astronomers active in 1986 are investigated separately.
