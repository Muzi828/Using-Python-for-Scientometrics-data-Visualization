Firms operating in science-based technological fields reflect some of the complexities of the science-technology interaction. The present study attempts to investigate these interactions by analyzing patent citations, publications and patent outputs of multinational corporations (MNCs) in 'thin film' technology. In particular we explore different characteristics of knowledge production and knowledge utilization of these firms. The results indicate no correlation between intensity of research activity and patents produced by the MNCs. The relationship between scientific and technological knowledge generation as well as the linkage between science and technology appear to be firm-specific rather than dependent on a technological or industrial sector. The dispersion of journal sources for the majority of patent citations of scientific literature as well as for the majority of scientific outputs is narrow. Basic journals play an important role in patent citation as well as in addressing research of MNCs in thin-film technology.
