An estimation about Cuban scientific productivity based on output indicators during the period 1985-1989 is provided. Nine international bibliographic databases and three Cuban repertories have been used. Except for journal articles, no other type of Cuban document gets worldwide recognition as they are not generally included in the international databases. The greater effort in research is made in Agriculture, Biomedicine, Chemistry and Engineering, but this last topic does not reach international visibility, since the majority of its results are published in local journals. The Cuban contribution to the ''mainstream'' of world science is increasing annually. Collaboration in high level research projects existed mainly between Cuba and either USSR, German Democratic Republic and Italy. The most productive Cuban institutions in collaborative programs are the Havana University and the Academy of Sciences.
