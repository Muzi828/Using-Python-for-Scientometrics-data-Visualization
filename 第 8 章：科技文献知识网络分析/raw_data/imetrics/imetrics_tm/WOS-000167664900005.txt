The main purposes of this article are to uncover interesting features in real-world citation networks, and to highlight important substructures. In particular. it applies lattice theory to citation analysis. On the applied side, it shows that lattice substructures exist in real-word citation networks. It is further shown that, through its relations with co-citations and bibliographic coupling, the diamond (a four-element lattice) is a basic structural element in citation analysis. Finally, citation compactness is calculated for the four- and five element lattices.
