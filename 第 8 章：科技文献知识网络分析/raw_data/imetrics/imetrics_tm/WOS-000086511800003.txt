Only multidimensional analyses can provide overviews of complex relationships among many variables. We have previously illustrated the use of Correspondence Factor Analysis (CFA) in the analysis of publication profiles. In this article, we retrace our activity in patent analysis from the late 1970s to the present day and show how CFA is a particularly useful tool not only for describing the correlations between countries and technological Fields but also for highlighting non-linear patenting time trends.
