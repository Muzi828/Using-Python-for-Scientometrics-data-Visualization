This paper aims at analyzing and extracting the research groups from the co-authorship network of oncology in China. By use of centrality, component analysis, K-Core, M-Slice, Hierarchical Clustering analysis, and Multidimensional Scaling analysis, we studied the data from 10 Core Chinese Oncology journals between 2000 and 2009, analyzed the structure character of the Chinese Oncology research institutes. This study advances the methods for selecting the most prolific research groups and individuals in Chinese Oncology research community, and provides basis for more productive cooperation in the future. This study also provides scientific evidences and suggestions for policymakers to establish a more efficient system for managing and financing Chinese Oncology research in the future.
