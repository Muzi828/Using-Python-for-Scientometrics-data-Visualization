An indicator was developed to analyze the distribution of EC support to research projects in the less favoured peripheral regions of Europe, compared to support in the economically stronger com regions. For this purpose it was assumed that in theory EC research funds and contracts would tend, on average, to be allocated according to the scientific potential of each country or region. An R & D activity is considered to contribute to socio-economic cohesion if the share obtained by the less favoured regions is larger than their share of the total European scientific potential. This assessment was made both for the total of all R & D activities and for each specific research programme. It emerges that the requirement for high scientific standards is not an obstacle to the participation of less favoured regions in Community research.
