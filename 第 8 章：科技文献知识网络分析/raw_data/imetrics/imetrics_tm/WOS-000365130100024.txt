By analyzing the complete 2003-2007 publication lists of two top-ranking political science departments in Germany, this study explores the publication patterns of German political scientists and also analyzes their citation and reference characteristics. Two main communication networks in the publication patterns of German political scientists are distinguished in this study. The significant local communication network covers monographs and regionally-oriented journals that are mainly written in German. Its importance has slightly decreased over time. By contrast, the relatively smaller international one, which covers international publications in English, increased its volume slightly. The younger political scientists have more internationally-oriented publication behaviors, and thus would benefit in an evaluation from an international perspective. The average impact of WoS-indexed items in this study was found to be higher than the average impact in political science. In general, a growing degree of international orientation in this field can be expected as time elapses.
