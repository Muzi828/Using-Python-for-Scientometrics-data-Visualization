In 2014 Thomson Reuters (TR, provider of the Web of Science, WoS) published a list of highly-cited researchers worldwide. This includes those scientists who have published the most papers in their discipline which belong to the 1 % of the most-cited papers. Bornmann and Bauer (J Assoc Inf Sci Technol, in press) have presented a first evaluation in which the scientists are evaluated on the basis of their affiliations. In this short communication we would like to indicate how the TR data can be used to perform a meaningful country-specific evaluation. Germany serves as the example for the analysis.
