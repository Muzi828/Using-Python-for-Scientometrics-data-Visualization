We propose an improved Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model to evaluate the efficiency of research groups in the area of information science in PR China. By taking the research groups as Decision Making Units (DMUs), the budget of the projects and size of the groups as inputs and the quantity and quality of publications produced by the groups as outputs of the model, the relative efficiencies of 21 research projects are evaluated. Then, we move to focus on the issues of knowledge management of the organizations that undertook these projects and attempt to explore the underlying reasons of high research efficiency. Through integrating the evaluation outcomes into research process, three indicators of knowledge management are identified for the best practice groups with highest research efficiency. The findings verify that the proposed model is valid and practical to assess research performances on the basis of bibliometric indicators.
