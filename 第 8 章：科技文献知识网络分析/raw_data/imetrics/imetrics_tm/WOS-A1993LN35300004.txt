Analysis of the Canadian publications in the field of aquaculture reveals that Canada is one of the word's major contributors in this area. This confirms that Canada's expertise in science and technology often finds its stimulus in its resource-based industries. Several bibliometric indicators were used to enlighten the peculiar features of the Canadian research system.  These include the channels of communication used by scientists, the authorship pattern, the level of collaboration, the identification of the institutions in which the research is performed and the uneven research effort distribution inside the country. The relevance of such quantitative measures for science policy-making is emphasized. The present study shows how bibliometric analysis, by describing the actual strengths and weaknesses of Canadian research and identifying the agents of this research activity, might foster a better understanding of the Canadian research enterprise as a whole.
