He and Pao's method of identifying specific discipline journals is improved by adding the citing impact factor and self-citing rate. The proposed indicator strikes a balance by discounting the size of a discipline. And also this indicator paves the way to identify the constituent journals of a discipline. This method was tested in Physics, Applied Physics and Astronomy and Astrophysics. The findings lead to the rethinking about the inclusion of many journals in these fields.
