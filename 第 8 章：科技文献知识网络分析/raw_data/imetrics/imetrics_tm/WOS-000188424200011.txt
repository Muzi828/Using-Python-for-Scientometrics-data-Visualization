This study presents a literature review concerning the preciseness of over 170 publications citing the original Lagergren's paper in kinetics equation for solute adsorption on various adsorbents. This equation applies to a range of solid-liquid systems such as metal ions, dyestuffs and several organic substances in aqueous systems onto various adsorbents. The main objectives are to manifest different forms of citations presented and offers a correct reference style for citing the original Lagergren's paper published in 1898.
