The author applies the cognitive work analysis (CWA) approach to investigate human-work interaction in a corporate setting. This study reports the analysis of data collected from a Web survey, diaries, and telephone interviews. The results present characterizations of actors and the work domain; three dimensions for each of the four interactive activities involved in the human-work interaction and their relationships are identified. An enhanced model and its implications for the development of a corporate digital library are discussed.
