A full option method for determining impact takes into account citations to all cited publications, instead of limiting the analysis to ISI-publications only, as usually done in the standard method. The method was tested for the 258 early Ghent professors, teaching in 6 different faculties. The impact of monographs is, in general, much larger than the impact of articles (whether of ISI-type or not). This result remains valid for all six faculties separately Limiting the bibliometric visibility to ISI-publications reduces the number of citations to only 16%. Bibliometric spectra are presented, in which citations, cited publications and their impact are shown in function of the year of publication. The number of cited publications is always important to expose the influence of activity (production) upon bibliometric scores. For the faculty of Arts, the citations to early professors are compared with those obtained for the present-day generation: the bibliometric spectrum for the former group is rather discontinuous (showing a large erosion in the number of citations by year), whereas that of the latter is continuous. The Ghent citation data are also compared with those given internationally in the same period.
