The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) was designated a Pilot Project for Performance Planning under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. Of the more than 80 such pilot projects government-wide, ARL was the only organization to represent the R&D community. As such, it was required to break new ground in both the planning and the evaluation of basic and applied research. This paper discusses the efforts made by ARL in both these areas, the insights drawn from these efforts, and the lessons learned.
