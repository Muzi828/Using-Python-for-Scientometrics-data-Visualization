The examination of three samples of geological scientific publications: (A) 9 journals from Western Europe and USA; (B) 10 up-to-date review books, and (C) 3 sections of Volume 127 (1990-1991) of the Zoological Record, shows that the statement that English is now the lingua franca in geological sciences is only in part true, but reflects a desire by many people in the scientific community, a desire which may not yet have been fulfilled.
