This article discusses the methodological problems of integrating scientometric methods into a; qualitative study. Integrative attempts of this kind are poorly supported by the methodologies of both the sociology of science and scientometrics. Therefore it was necessary to develop a project-specific methodological approach that linked scientometric methods to theoretical considerations. The methodological approach is presented and used to discuss general methodological problems concerning the relation between (qualitative) theory and scientometric methods. This discussion: enables some conclusions to be drawn as to the relations that exist between scientometrics and them sociology of science.
