An analysis of serials preferred and cited in various communications by the Indian oceanographers during 1963 to 1992 is presented. A shift in preference of serials from general sciences to oceanography (interdisciplinary) and to core subject in oceanography is noticed. The contributions to Indian serials showed a decrease. The implications of this trend are discussed. The rank list of serials cited by Indian oceanographers was correlated with the rank list of serials cited at international level. A negative correlation with a marginal difference of -0.214 is observed between these two rank lists. This difference is attributed to studies from different geographical areas in these two rank sets. Bradford graphs for all datasets, but one, showed typical Bradford-Leimkuhler curves with or without clear Groos droops. Further research is required to explain this exceptional curve. A country-wise analysis of the serials preferred as well as cited in communications give a clear picture on the shift during the period of study. English is considered as the lingua franca by Indian oceanographers.
