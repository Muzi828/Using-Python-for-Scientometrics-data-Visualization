In an evaluation of physics research programs in the Netherlands, held in 1996, assessments of research by expert panels were supplemented with bibliometric analysis. This latter analysis included the calculation of several bibliometric indicators, among which some taking journal impact measures as a baseline. Final outcomes of this evaluation provided an opportunity to re-examine the results of this assessment from the perspective of the degree of interdisciplinarity of programs involved. In this paper we discuss results of this latter analysis, in particular with respect to the relation between several citation based indicators and interdisciplinary research in Dutch physics.
