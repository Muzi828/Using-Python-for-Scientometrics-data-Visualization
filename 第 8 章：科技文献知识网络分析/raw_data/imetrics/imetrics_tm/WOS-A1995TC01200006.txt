Using recent original data from three different sources, the article exhibits some strengths and weaknesses of science in Colombia. It shows that research in this country is in a process of growth although recent results of this positive trend are still to be confirmed. Comparing the evolution of science in Colombia with that of Latin America as a whole, describing and explaining its geographical and institutional concentration as well as its thematic distribution, it also reveals the interdependance between science production dynamics and international cooperation programmes. A basic argument is that the development of science in this country, even though it is fragile and erratic, does not lack sound bases. The indicators used suggest indeed an autonomous scientific motion and inspiration which does not contradict the internationalization process of Colombian science but rectifies the picture of an excessively isolated or dependent community that used to be portrayed.
