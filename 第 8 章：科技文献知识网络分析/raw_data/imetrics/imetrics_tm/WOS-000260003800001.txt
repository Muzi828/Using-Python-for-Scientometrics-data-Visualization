In this paper, we show a "Strategic Diagram" of the robot technology by applying the co-word analysis to the metadata of Korean related national R&D projects in 2001. The strategic diagram shows the evolutionary trends of the specific R&D domain and relational patterns between sub-domains. We may use this strategic diagram to support both the strategic planning and the R&D Program.
