In the past 30 years, publications from either China or Germany have increased exponentially with China growing much faster especially in the natural sciences, engineering and technology. In medical and health sciences, however, China still lags behind Germany in terms of publication production. Germany performs better in producing high-quality papers (measured by citations). Collaboration between the two countries has increased significantly, especially in the natural sciences and engineering and technology, but less so in medical and health sciences. Collaboration between China and Germany may help to raise quality of Chinese research in terms of highly cited papers.
