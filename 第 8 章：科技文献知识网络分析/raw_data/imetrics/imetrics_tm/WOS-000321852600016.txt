In this study, new centrality (collaborative) measures are proposed for a node in weighted networks in three different categories. The bibliometric indicators' concepts (e.g., h-index and g-index) are applied to the network analysis measures in order to introduce the new centrality measures. First category of measures (i.e., l-index, al-index and gl-index) only considers a node's neighbors' degree. Second category of measures (i.e., h-Degree, a-Degree and g-Degree) takes into account the links' weights of a node in a weighted network. Third category of measures (i.e., Hw-Degree, Aw-Degree and Gw-Degree) combines both neighbors' degree and their links' weight. Using a co-authorship network, the association between these new measures and the existing measures with scholars' performance is examined to show the applicability of the new centrality measures. The analysis shows that the scholars' citation-based performances measures are significantly associated with all the proposed centrality measures but the correlation coefficient for the ones based on average indicators (i.e., a-Degree and Aw-Degree) is the highest.
