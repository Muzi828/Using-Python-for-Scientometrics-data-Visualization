Relations of three relative scientometric indicators (Relative Citation Rate, RCR, Relative Subfield Citedness, R-W, and Relative Publication Strategy, RPS) are studied. R-W can be calculated by the percentage share of citations divided by that of publications. The findings indicate that publishing in journals with relatively high impact factor is a necessary but not sufficient condition for attaining a high R-W index.
