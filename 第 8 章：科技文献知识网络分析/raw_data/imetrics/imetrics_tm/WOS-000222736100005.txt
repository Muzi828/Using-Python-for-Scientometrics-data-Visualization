To make good decisions, businesses try to gather good intelligence information. Yet managing and processing a large amount of unstructured information and data stand in the way of greater business knowledge. An effective business intelligence tool must be able to access quality information from a variety of sources in a variety of forms, and it must support people as they search for and analyze that information. The EBizPort system was designed to address information needs for the business/IT community. EBizPort's collection-building process is designed to acquire credible, timely, and relevant information. The user interface provides access to collected and metasearched resources using innovative tools for summarization, categorization, and visualization. The effectiveness, efficiency, usability, and information quality of the EBizPort system were measured. EBizPort significantly outperformed Brint, a business search portal, in search effectiveness, information quality, user satisfaction, and usability. Users particularly liked EBizPort's clean and user-friendly interface. Results from our evaluation study suggest that the visualization function added value to the search and analysis process, that the generalizable collection-building technique can be useful for domain-specific information searching on the Web, and that the search interface was important for Web search and browse support.
