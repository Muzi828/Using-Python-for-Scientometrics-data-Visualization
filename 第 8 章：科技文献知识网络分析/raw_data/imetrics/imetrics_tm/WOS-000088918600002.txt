There is sufficient evidence to prove the potential of immobilized enzymes to be commercially successful in many industries, but a survey of products in biotechnology and some reports indicate its limited success. To visualize the factual status, the present study looks into trends and profiles of this field using scientometric methods. The salient results show a steady decline in outputs in the form of patents and publications since 1993 along with a decline in the number of groups from academics and industries. Among the countries involved, there is also a decline, though USA and Japan show some strength in basic and applied research, respectively.
