Eight different indicators are calculated on the basis of an extensive bibliography on science in Cote d'Ivoire, and presented by scientific domain in polar graphs.  They permit to have a synthetic image of scientific activity and distinguish different scientific styles.  Moreover the notion of "colonial science" is re-evaluated, and a case is made in order to distinguish between different ways of doing science.  The indicators and graphic representation proposed here may be a valid method to identify differing patterns at a glance.
