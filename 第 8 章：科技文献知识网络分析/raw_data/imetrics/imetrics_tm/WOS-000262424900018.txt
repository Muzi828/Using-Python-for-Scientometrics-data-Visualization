Drawing on network theory, this study considers the content of U.S. presidential debates and how candidates' language differentiates them. Semantic network analyses of all U.S. presidential debates (1960-2004) were conducted. Results reveal that regardless of party affiliation, election winners were more central in their semantic networks than losers. Although the study does not argue causation between debating and electoral outcomes, results show a consistent pattern: Candidates who develop coherent, central, semantically structured messages in debates seem to be victorious on election day. An argument is made for employing semantic networks in studying debates and political discourse.
