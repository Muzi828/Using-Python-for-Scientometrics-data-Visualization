I examine whether or not new scientific specialties present young scientists with better opportunities to make significant discoveries than established specialties by examining a series of significant discoveries in the first 22 years of the field of bacteriology. I found that it was middle aged scientists, not young scientists, who were responsible for a disproportionate number of significant discoveries. I argue that in order to make significant discoveries scientists need to work their way into the center of the social network of a scientific research community. Only then will they have access to the material and social resources necessary to make such discoveries.
