By the end of the seventies, there was in Venezuela a solidly entrenched scientific community. Scientists were mostly full time, satisfied or very satisfied with their work, relatively well paid and with adequate facilities to do research. Beginning in 1982, when a process of inflation and devaluation started in the country as a whole, there has been a twilight of the scientific community, leading to migration of scientists abroad or to industry. The Government has announced drastic measures to bring up the budget for science and technology from 0.3 to 2.0% of gross national product. If these measures are indeed implemented, there will be a dawn without having to go through a long night.
