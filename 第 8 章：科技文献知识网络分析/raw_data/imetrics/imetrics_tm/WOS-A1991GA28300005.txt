Under the sponsorship of the U.S. National Science Foundation, CHI Research, Inc. developed the bibliometric indicators for the U.S. National Science Board's Science Indicators Reports starting with Science Indicators 1972.  In the work reported here, for the Commission of the European Communities, CHI has extended the Science Indicators techniques and database to a study of publication, coauthorship and citation within 28 scientific fields related to various European Community programs.
Perhaps the most important finding of the research was that internationally coauthored papers - papers authored by scientists affiliated with institutions in more than one EC country - were cited two times as highly as papers authored by scientists working at a single institution within a single country.  These EC-EC internationally coauthored papers were cited as highly as EC-Non EC and Non-EC papers.  This indicates that the internationally linked European science is of as high impact as any other science in the world.
A second key finding was that, after compensating for national scientific size, the degree of international coauthorship did not appear to be particularly dependent upon size.  However, linguistic and cultural factors were found to be very strong.  The patterns of coauthorship amongst the European countries are far from homogeneous, and are quite heavily affected by linguistic, historical, and cultural factors.
Finally, it was found that international coauthorship is increasing steadily, both within and outside of the Community, with some evidence that international cooperation is increasing more rapidly in scientific fields that have been targeted by the Commission.
