A new percentile-based rating scale P100 has recently been proposed to describe the citation impact in terms of the distribution of the unique citation values. Here I investigate P100 for 5 example datasets, two simple fictitious models and three larger empirical samples. Counterintuitive behavior is demonstrated in the model datasets, pointing to difficulties when the evolution with time of the indicator is analyzed or when different fields or publication years are compared. It is shown that similar problems can occur for the three larger datasets of empirical citation values. Further, it is observed that the performance evaluation result in terms of percentiles can be influenced by selecting different journals for publication of a manuscript. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
