This study explores the curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) association of three classical dimension of co-authorship network centrality, degree, closeness and betweenness and the research performance in terms of g-index, of authors embedded in a co-authorship network, considering formal rank of the authors as a moderator between network centrality and research performance. We use publication data from ISI Web of Science (from years 2002-2009), citation data using Publish or Perish software for years 2010-2013 and CV's of faculty members. Using social network analysis techniques and Poisson regression, we explore our research questions in a domestic co-authorship network of 203 faculty members publishing in Chemistry and it's sub-fields within a developing country, Pakistan. Our results reveal the curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) association of direct and distant co-authorship ties (degree centrality) with research performance with formal rank having a positive moderating role for lower ranked faculty.
