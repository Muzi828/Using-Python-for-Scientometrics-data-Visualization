The present paper studies fractal features (such as the fractal dimension) of hypertext systems (such as WWW) and establishes the link with informetric parameters. More concretely, a formula for the fractal dimension in function of the average number of hyperlinks per page is presented and examples are calculated. In general the complexity of these systems is high. This is also expressed by formulae for the total number of hypertext systems that are possible, given a fixed number of documents.
