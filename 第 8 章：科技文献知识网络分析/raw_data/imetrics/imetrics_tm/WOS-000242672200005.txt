China has made great progress in economy and science in the last two decades. Its scientific development in gastroenterology has been seldom reported. Using two authoritative bibliographic databases, Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) and Medline, we analyze China's research output in gastroenterology journals from 1990 to 2004. After detailed analysis, we found that China have greatly advanced in gastroenterology research, but the growth of Chinese articles in gastroenterology journals can largely be attributed to the selection of China-based journals into international bibliographic databases.
