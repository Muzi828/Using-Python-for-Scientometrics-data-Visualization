Analysis of sociointerpersonal communication patterns among discourse participants is essential to understand the manifestation of and the interpersonal-communication features realized in online social interaction. The linguistic politeness theory provides an effective framework for such an analysis of sociointerpersonal communication features employed by online language users to maintain and enhance their public self-image, or face. The qualitative data analysis of this study, drawn from the real-time, online discussions of K-12 students, makes evident that interpersonal-communication features appear in the form of politeness tactics. The results of the study show that there is decreased use of deferential linguistic forms; on the contrary, a variety of verbal and nonverbal devices that denote positive politeness and bald-on-record (i.e., direct speech acts) frequently occur. The commonality of positive politeness and bald-on-record lies in the fact that both tactics are grounded in the nature of the close interpersonal relationships between participants. Such a communication pattern in the real-time, online discourse of K-12 students signifies that cognitive assessment of sociointerpersonal and contextual variables undertaken by speech participants underlies the realization of linguistic politeness. Employment of such politeness tactics indicates that effective and fully realized interpersonal communication plays a vital role in the development of online social interaction.
