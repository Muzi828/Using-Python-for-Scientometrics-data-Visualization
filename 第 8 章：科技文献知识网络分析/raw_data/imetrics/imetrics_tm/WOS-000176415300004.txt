In this paper we have analyzed the pattern of cooperation links among fifty most prolific institutions (hereafter called "elite institutions") in India. The network of relationships among these institutions is sparse and more than two thirds of the cells in the collaboration matrix are empty. The network is centralized, but no institution dominates the network. It is only a set of few institutions that dominate the network. We have constructed a measure (Bonacich eigenvector centrality index) to assess the position of each institution in the network. Barring a few notable exceptions, scientific size of an institution is directly related to its position in the network. We have graphically depicted the network of relationships among these institutions above a certain threshold of cooperation strength. The network incorporating 50 nodes and 171 arcs provides a synoptic view of bilateral relations among the institutions, but it is quite complex. We have therefore developed a block model of the network to assess the macro level features of cooperation links among the institutions. The block model indicates the isolation and marginality of certain clusters (or blocks) of institutions.
