The Science Citation Index (SCI) with its coverage of journals has been forming a criterion for the performance assessment of researchers worldwide. If the journals of a specialty were under-proportionally indexed, its development in research could be distorted in the long term. A MEDLINE-based bibliometric analysis of research output by family medicine departments in Taiwan from 1990 to 2003 might help to provide some evidence of the influence of SCI on the developing disciplines.
