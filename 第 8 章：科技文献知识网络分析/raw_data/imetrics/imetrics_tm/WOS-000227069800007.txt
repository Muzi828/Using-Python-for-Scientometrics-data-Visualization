This paper attempts to highlight the scientific productivity, productivity age, collaboration trend, domains of contributions of eight Nobel laureates of past and present belonging to different domains of research in science. Also attempts to document the various factors that affect productivity of scientists. No Nobel laureates can be compared with other Nobel laureates as they are an altogether different class of scientific elites and each piece of research is unique by itself.
