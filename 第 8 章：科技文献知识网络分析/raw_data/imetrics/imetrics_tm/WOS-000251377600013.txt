This study develops three alternative models of academic library Web site usage based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The three alternative models depict relationships among various intrinsic and extrinsic determinant factors of an academic library's Web site usage. The four factors included in the models are perceived ease-of-use, perceived usefulness, service functionality, and task functionality. These four factors are hypothesized to affect directly or indirectly both factors of satisfaction and intention-to-use. LISREL analysis using survey data shows that the best-fit model is the "Dual Mediation Impact" Model. Research and managerial implications for the academic library are discussed. Future research directions and limitations also are provided.
