About a decade ago the German Science Council requested a strengthening of academic research at the German economic research institutes to improve the academic foundation of policy advice - the traditional task of the institutes. Based on publications in SSCI journals, research output has since then improved remarkably in scope and quality and has involved an ever rising number of scholars within the institutes. It can be considered to be a substantial success, which should be internationally recognized. The present study demonstrates that for a wide range of different methods the rankings of publication performance is fairly robust. The results are distorted, however, if they are based on a highly selective list of journals as was the case in previous literature.
