Semiconductor is the key element for information industry. The present study investigated the growth of semiconductor literature based on the database of INSPEC. Well-established bibliometric techniques, such as Bradford-Zipfs plot and Lotka's law have been employed to further explore the characteristics of semiconductor literature. Quantitative results on the literature growth, form of publication, research treatment, publishing country and language, author productivity and affiliate are reported. Moreover, from the Bradford-Zipfs plot, 25 core journals in semiconductor were identified and analyzed.
