The paper investigates the online citation analysis possibilities and limitations. The following online processing tools: RANK, MAP, and TARGET, provided by Dialog, are incorporated in order to perform analyses of citations to and from isolated sets of documents as well as to carry out diachrone journal analyses. These analyses imply further to determine journal impact factors of ISI journals. Measures of the scope of internationalisation of journals are proposed and demonstrated. By the combined application of the RANK and TARGET commands we demonstrate a hitherto overlooked possibility of working with bibliographic coupling online and mapping of scientific fields.
