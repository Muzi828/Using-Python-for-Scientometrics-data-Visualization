In this paper the relationship between knowledge production and the structure of research networks in two scientific fields is assessed. We investigate whether knowledge production corresponds positively or negatively with different types of social network structure. We show that academic fields generate knowledge in different ways and that within the fields, different types of networks act as a stimulant for knowledge generation.
