This paper presents an overview of recent R&D policy developments in Flanders and Belgium. Special attention is paid to evaluation and monitoring, which are seen as central elements of the Flemish Government's more dynamic science and technology policy. The paper describes the process of setting up the necessary instruments to perform bibliometric studies and the application of these instruments for drawing a profile of the natural, life and technical sciences research carried out in Flanders. Although the total publication output weighted by population or regional wealth, is still lower than that of other small, highly industrialised countries, the international visibility of this research is comparable, if not slightly higher.
