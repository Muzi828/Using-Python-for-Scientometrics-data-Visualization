In this paper we assess the utility of the curriculum vita (CV) as a data source for examining the career paths of scientists and engineers. CVs were obtained in response to an email message sent to researchers working in the areas of biotechnology and microelectronics. In addition, a number of CVs were obtained "passively" from a search of the Internet. We discuss the methodological issues and problems of this data collection strategy and the results from an exploratory analysis using OLS regression and event history analysis. In sum, despite difficulties with coding and variation in CV formats, this collection strategy seems to us to hold much promise.
