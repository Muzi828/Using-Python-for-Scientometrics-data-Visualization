The decade beginning 1925 is important in the history of medical science in modern India. This is evident from the bibliometric study of the publications in the Indian Medical Gazette, from 1900 to 1945. The paper studies the evolution of collaboration in the field of medical sciences during this period. In order to do so the study determines the: (i) pattern of collaboration in basic and applied research in medical science; (ii) trends in the multiplicity of authors; and (iii) the type of collaboration for the period 1900-1945. The collaborative and authorship trends discussed in the paper suggests that medical science was still in the developing stage in India in the period 1900-1945, and there was a possibility of its expansion in the near future.
