A person can die at any age. It is an omni-spoken common saying. Is it really true? Are all ages equally prone to die? Does there exist some predictable pattern that may conjecture the incidence of death? These are the questions that are attempted here in this article. Literature is replete with cohort dependant age distributions and pyramids that focus, and are adjusted, primarily for the living persons. The current article is using a cohort free group of people and focuses exclusively on age at death to rummage for some pattern in these ages. A statistical investigation is made of the life span of human beings of previous two centuries. The life span, or age, distribution is revealed to be a quadric modal in nature, refuting the prevailed myth that all ages are equally susceptible to death.
