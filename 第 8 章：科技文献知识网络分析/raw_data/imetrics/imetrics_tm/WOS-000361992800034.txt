In past 15 years, haze has become one of the most concerned environmental problem in China. This study examines China's performance on haze research using scientometrics indicators such as China's global publication share, rank, growth rate and citation impact, its publications in various areas, top journals based on last 15 years (2000-2014) publications data obtained from ISI Science citation index expanded database. Chinese share with international collaborative papers, h-core papers and high-cited papers were also determined. The results indicated a constantly rise in the amount of published papers, the average citations per paper and the presence of Chinese researchers and institutions in top journals. However, the impact and quality of the papers were far to satisfactory. There was still a great gap for impact between China and developed countries (G7 countries) in haze research.
