An analysis carried out on the 4.326 periodicals in the social sciences included in the most recent 1991 printed edition of the UNESCO DARE database showed that 64% of the world's production is published by High Income Economy countries (IEC). Only 0.7% of Low IEC journals in the UNESCO database were also present in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCT) for the same year while corresponding figures for the Middle and High IEC were 2.3%, and 97.0%, respectively. With the notable exception of the United States, all countries had fewer journals in SSCI than in UNESCO database.
