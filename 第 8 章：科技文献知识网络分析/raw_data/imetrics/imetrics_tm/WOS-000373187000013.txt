In collaboration with the managers of a university, we have conducted an action research to gauge the adequacy of texts written by researchers in the doctoral programs of the institution as the input (content) for the university's distance learning program. For the analyses, bibliometric data were collected regarding the articles in question from the regional SciELO repository. This repository was chosen because the articles are mostly published in Portuguese, which is in the domain of the target readership of the distance learning project. It was observed that there was a need for an indicator that related the number of downloads of an article to the total number of downloads of the journal in which it was published. Thus, we propose the D-index, defined as the number of papers with download number a parts per thousand yend, as a useful index for characterizing the academic popularity (hits) of a journal. The first applications of the D-index in terms of professional practice were positive, given its usefulness and practicality. The D-index aids the analysis of the download of an article, which is a fundamental event for subsequent reading, internalization and learning. An analysis of this set of actions is essential to the context of regional repositories, as their mission also includes the dissemination of information to aid the learning and education of their readers.
