We have compared patenting propensity in the Czech Republic with eight EU countries: Germany, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Finland, Belgium, Ireland and Greece. In comparison based on the EPO and USPTO patents listed per million inhabitants, the Czech Republic ranks rather low. The Czech Republic also generated fewer patents per R&D employee than most other countries. The time series data have shown a decrease of number of Czech patents after 1990 with some revival after 1996. As our analysis indicated, the decrease was partially caused by dissolution or transformation of major patent generators, but the most important cause may lie in a little interest of local enterprises.
