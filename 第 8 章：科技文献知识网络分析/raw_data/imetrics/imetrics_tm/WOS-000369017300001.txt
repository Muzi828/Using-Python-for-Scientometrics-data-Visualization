The purpose of this study is to explore and compare citations and discipline distribution in journal articles and books in the field of information society. By investigating citations, co-citation analysis and social network analysis, this study highlights the major disciplines in the information society field, identifies the highly-cited works and the relationships among them, and analyzes the multidisciplinary nature of the field. A total of 84 selective documents related to the study of information society were collected. The Web of Science, including Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, Arts and Humanities Citation Index, and Book Citation Index, was selected to search for citation and co-citation data from 2005 to 2012. A co-citation matrix was built and subject clusters were determined. Moreover, co-citation data acquired from a social network analysis tool, UCINET, were put through centrality analysis to explore the influence of each document in the field of information society. Conclusions were made based on research results.
