Gender studies is a growing field in academe. It is intrinsically associated with feminism and political reforms, and has in Sweden enjoyed exclusive resources and legislated support. The present study aims to characterize gender studies published by authors based in Sweden, and poses a number of hypotheses regarding its rate of growth, impact, and other bibliographical variables. To this end, publications concerning gender by authors based at Swedish universities were collected from a range of sources and compiled to form a population database of publications between 2000 and 2010. The results show from which universities and disciplines the gender studies authors come from, and in which journals they are most frequently published. We also compare the proportion of gender studies to the entire body of publications from a number of countries, and show that in Sweden it has grown faster than other types of publications. A comparison between literatures that consider socially constructed gender or biological sex showed that the former is less cited and published in journals with lower IF than the latter. Our Swedish Gender Studies List population database, which also features an international, non-exhaustive comparison sample that is matched to the Swedish sample in certain respects, is made available for further scientific study of this literature, for example by enabling the extraction of random samples.
