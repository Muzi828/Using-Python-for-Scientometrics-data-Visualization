The research streams of transition economies and emerging markets have some common ground, but yet differ. The goal of this study is to provide a better understanding of the commonalities and differences regarding trends and topics of this cross-disciplinary research area. We employ the novel method of topic models on a corpus of nearly 6,000 articles in more than 600 journals from 1995 to 2012 to identify 25 topics and analyze their trends and use across scope (transition or emerging), disciplines (business or economics) and geography (countries or regions).
