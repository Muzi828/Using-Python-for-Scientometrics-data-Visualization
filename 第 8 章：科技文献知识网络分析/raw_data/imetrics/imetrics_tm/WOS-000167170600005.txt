Electronic publishing developments and new information technology in general will affect the main functions of scientific communication. Most changes however will be primarily technological hut not conceptual. Publication via journals of high reputation is in most fields of science crucial to receive professional recognition. That will remain so in the "electronic era". A much more revolutionary change in science will be the increasing availability and sharing of research data.
