I aim to advance our understanding of the size of scientific specialties. Derek Price's groundbreaking work has provided us with valuable conceptual tools and data for making progress on this issue. But, I argue that his estimate of 100 scientists per specialty is flawed. He fails to take into account the fact that the average publishing scientist publishes only 3.5 articles throughout her career. Hence, rather than consisting of 100 scientists, I have suggested that specialties are probably somewhat larger, perhaps somewhere between 250 and 600 scientists.
