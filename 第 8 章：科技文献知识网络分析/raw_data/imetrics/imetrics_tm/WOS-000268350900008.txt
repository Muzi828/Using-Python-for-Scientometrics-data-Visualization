This article describes an information retrieval approach according to the two different search modes that exist: browsing an ontology (via categories) or defining a query in free language (via keywords). Various proposals offer approaches adapted to one of these two modes. We present a proposal leading to a system allowing the integration of both modes using the same search engine. This engine is adapted according to each possible search mode.
