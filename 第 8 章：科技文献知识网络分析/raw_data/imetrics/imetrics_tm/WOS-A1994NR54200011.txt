The paper is divided in two parts. Part I deals with the novel use of the concept of entropy H(measured in nepers) of the age T of references cited in the literature of a specialty, and the derived parameter S=exp(H) (measured in years). We have proposed to use S (or H) as a measure of the obsolescence of the literature. The concept of entropy comes from the Theory of Information (Shannon) where its mathematical properties have been widely studied and are thus available. H and S have been calculated for the log-normal probability density functions (which model the empirical distributions of T) of some IEEE journals and for the 58-year collection of an electronics journal, and then they have been compared to the total utility function, this latter defined in the literature. Part II recalls and discusses the mean residual life, M(T), and the expected life E(T), of a reference of age T (concepts borrowed from lifetime data analysis). Besides their intrinsic applications. another possible application of these concepts may be in defining quantitatively the age of ''historical'' papers. Examples taken from the literatures of the XX and XIX centuries have been reported.
