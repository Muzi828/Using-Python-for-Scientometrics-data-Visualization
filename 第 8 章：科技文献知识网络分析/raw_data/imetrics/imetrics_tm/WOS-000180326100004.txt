An analysis of 1317 papers published in first fifty volumes during 1978 to 2001 of the international journal Scientometrics indicates the heterogeneity of the field with emphasis on scientometric assessment. The study indicates that the US share of papers is constantly on the decline while that of the Netherlands, India, France and Japan is on the rise. The research output is highly scattered as indicated by the average number of papers per institution. The scientometric output is dominated by the single authored papers, however, multi-authored papers are gaining momentum. Similar pattern has been observed for domestic and international collaboration.
