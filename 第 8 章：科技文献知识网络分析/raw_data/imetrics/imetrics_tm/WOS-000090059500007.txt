As a corollary of former studies, high performance in Brazilian Management Sciences during the period of 1981 to 1995 is put to scrutiny. Information on the 66 papers registered to this field in the ISI databases for this time interval were retrieved, edited and processed as to elicit patterns.
Occurrences of highly cited papers seemed haphazard but the presence of collaborative work consistently emerged as an important driving factor for good performance. International collaboration showed the most expressive impact over chances of citation but any form of collaboration seemed to have some effect, even those represented by single authors with double allegiance. Simple addition of authors, nonetheless, had no effect, and thus collaboration involving authors of common institutional affiliation showed the performance of single authored papers.
Cluster analysis allowed the identification of patterns of performance, and groups of best performers showed higher levels of international collaboration. The institutional composition of the clusters is presented.
