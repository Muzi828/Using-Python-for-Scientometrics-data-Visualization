Basic publication-citation matrices are used to calculate informetric indicators such as journal impact factors or R-sequences. Transforming these publication-citation matrices clarifies the construction of other indicators. In this article, some transformations are highlighted together with some of their invariants. Such invariants offer a rigorous mathematically founded way of comparing informetric matrices before and after a transformation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
