Data obtained through letter poll over 143 researchers who authored the 240 highly cited documents (See the first phase of the study) were used to describe the informal aspects of communication between Chinese and non-Chinese superconductivity researchers. While non-Chinese researchers played both roles equally, Chinese scientists were the destination more often than they were the source in informal communication. Chinese scientists were less visible than their counterparts in the informal domain. The mapping of the informal communication activities among the superconductivity researchers shows that all Chinese scientists except Zhao ZX, a special liaison between the two groups of researchers, clustered away from their non-Chinese colleagues.
