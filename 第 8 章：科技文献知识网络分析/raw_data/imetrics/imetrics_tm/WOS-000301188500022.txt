The partnership ability index (phi) combines the number of co-authors and the times each of them acted as co-authors with a given author exactly the same way as Hirsch's h-index combines the number of publications and their citation rate. The index phi was tested on the sample of the Hevesy medal awardees. It was found that phi is consistent with Glanzel's model of h-index, and that higher phi values-at least until a certain limit-may be accompanied with higher citation visibility (h-index). Some further possibilities of application both within and outside the area of scientometrics are suggested.
