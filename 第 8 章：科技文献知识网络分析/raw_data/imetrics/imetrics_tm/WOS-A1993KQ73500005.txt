European authorship trends in fifteen major scientific and technical bibliographic databases on the DIALOG information system are examined for works published between 1970 and 1990. There was an increasing number of records with European authors in 21% of the data set. In 6%, an overall decline was found. In 52%, authorship increased into the 1980's, and then declined. The mort heavily represented countries were the former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. Overall, with the exception of MEDLINE, BIOSIS, and INSPEC, coverage of the works of European authors has been declining over the past twenty years and particularly so in the last five.
