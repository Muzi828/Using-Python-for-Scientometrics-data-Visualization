Clustering algorithms are used prominently in co-citation analysis by analysts aiming to reveal research streams within a field. However, clustering of widely cited articles is not robust to small variations in citation patterns. We propose an alternative algorithm, dense network sub-grouping, which identifies dense groups of co-cited references. We demonstrate the algorithm using a data set from the field of family business research and compare it to two alternative methods, multidimensional scaling and clustering. We also introduce a free software tool, Sitkis. that implements the algorithm and other common bibliometric methods. The software identifies journal-, country- and university-specific citation patterns and co-citation groups, enabling the identification of "invisible colleges.".
