Zipf's law was used to qualify all the key-words of documents in a data set. This qualification was used to build a graphical representation of the resulting indicator in each document The graphical resolution leads to a document dispatch in a three dimensional space. This graphical representation was used as an information retrieval tool without using any keyword. The presentation of a case study is internet available. The graph is drawn in Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML) allowing a dynamic picture which is linked to a Database Management System (FreeWais). The experimentation was drawn to get a first impression of documents data set by querying without any keyword.
