Nowadays, the Italian science sector is undergoing a strategic reform due to budget cuts and there is a need for measuring and evaluating research performance of public research institutes. This research presents a new measure to assess the scientific research performance of public research institutes. The new model is successfully applied to 108 public research institutes belonging to the Italian National Research Council, using data from year 2003 and displays the laboratories with high/low performance. The results are substantially stronger and quicker to obtain than those calculated by using conventional indicators. This model supports the policy-makers, who must decide about the level and direction of public funding for research and technology transfer.
