The association of the season of birth with lifetime intellectual achievement was studied by means of analysis of two data sets, one of the prominent chemists of the world and another of members of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS). It is found that a (statistically) significantly greater number of prominent chemists born before 1850 and of the full members of RAS born before 1875 were born in month of the winter half-year than of the summer one. The effect was gradually decreasing with time, the decrease being slower in Russia. The possible influence of the season of birth on the early personality development is discussed.
