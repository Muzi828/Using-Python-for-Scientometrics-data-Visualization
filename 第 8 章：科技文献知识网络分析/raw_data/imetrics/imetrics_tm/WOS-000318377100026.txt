The distributions of citations L, two- (IF2) and five-year impact factors (IF5), and citation half-lives lambda of journals published in different selected countries are analyzed using Langmuir-type relation: y(n) = y(0) {1 - alpha Kn/(1 + Kn)}, where y(n) denotes L-n, IF2(n) or IF5(n) of n-ranked journal, y(0) is the value of y(n) when journal rank n = 0, alpha is an empirical effectiveness parameter, and K is the Langmuir constant. It was found that: (1) the general features of the distribution of L-n, IF2(n) or IF5(n) of the journals published in different individual countries are similar to the results obtained before by the author from the analysis of the citation distribution data of papers of individual authors (K. Sangwal,Journal of Informetrics 7 (2013) 36-49), (2) in contrast to the theoretically expected value of the effectiveness parameter alpha = 1, the calculated values of alpha > 1 for journals published in different countries, (3) the trends of the distribution of cited half-lives lambda(n) of journals differ from those of L-n, IF2(n) and IF5(n) data for different countries, and show one, two or three linear regions, the longest linear regions with low slopes are observed in the case of countries publishing relatively high number of journals, and (4) the product of the Langmuir constant K and the number N of journals for the processes of citations and two- and five-year impact factors of journals published in different countries is constant for a process. The results suggest that: (1) the values of alpha > 1 are associated with a process that retards the generation of items (i.e. citations or impact factors), the difference (alpha - 1) being related to the dissemination of contents of the journals published by a country, and (2) the constancy of KN is related to the publication potential of a country.
