The paper describes the construction and functions of the Citation Database for Japanese Papers (CJP) developed at the National Institute of Informatics, Japan (NII), and the Impact Factors of CJP's source journals. Then statistical analyses of multidimensional scaling on citation counts for the academic society journals to measure relationship among the societies are described. We also introduce a new citation navigation system, CiNii, which enables users to access various resources provided by NIL such as NACSIS Electronic Library Service (NACSIS-ELS) to get electronic full-text of journal articles through citation links. Recent political developments in Japan towards enhancement of scientific information infrastructure are also introduced with its implication to research evaluation systems incorporating citation analyses.
