This research uses descriptive multivariate data-analytic techniques - in particular, multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis - to explore and visualize the structure of the pharmacy literature as refracted through the editorial policies of the International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA) database. Specifically, the co-occurrence of the section headings/codes, used to exhaustively categorize publications in the IPA database, are clustered and mapped to evaluate the usefulness of two methods of section heading assignment. A secondary purpose of this research is to evaluate the use of descriptive multivariate data-analytic techniques and co-classification analysis to explore and depict the structure of an inherently heterogeneous and multidisciplinary professional literature, such as pharmacy.
