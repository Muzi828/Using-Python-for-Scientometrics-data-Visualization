In his book "Scientific Progress". Rescher (1978, German ed. 1982, French ed. 1993) developed a principle of decreasing marginal returns of scientific research, which is based, inter alia. on a law of logarithmic returns and on Lotka's law in a certain interpretation. In the present paper, the historical precursors and the meaning of the principle are sketched out. It is reported on some empirical case studies concerning the principle spread over the literature. New bibliometric data are used about 19th-century mathematics and physics. They confirm Rescher's principle apart From the early phases of the disciplines where a square root law seems to be more applicable. The implication of the principle that the returns of different quality levels grow the slower, the higher the level, is valid. However, the time-derivative ratio between (logarithmized) investment in terms of manpower and returns in terms of first-rate contributors seems not to be linear, but rather to fluctuate vividly, pointing to the cyclical nature of scientific progress. With regard to Rescher's principle, in the light of bibliometric indicators no difference occurs between a natural science like physics and a formal science like mathematics. From mathematical progress of the 19th century, constant or increasing returns in the form of new formulas, theorems and axioms are observed, which leads to a complementary interpretation of the principle of decreasing marginal returns as a principle of scientific "mass production".
