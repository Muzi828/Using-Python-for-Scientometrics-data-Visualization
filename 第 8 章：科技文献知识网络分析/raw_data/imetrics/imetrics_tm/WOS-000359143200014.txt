In this paper we investigate the BRIC and CIVETS economies from a new perspective, focusing on the analysis of one element linked to the knowledge economy. Concretely, we analyze the research-oriented repositories of those emerging markets as instruments that contribute to capture and diffuse scientific knowledge. For this end, we carry out a competitive analysis that allows us to study the BRIC and CIVETS repositories using their respective participation shares in terms of content supply, web visibility and size. The results reveal the absolute leadership position that the BRIC economy has over the CIVETS economy in terms of disseminating scientific knowledge as well as that this could weaken in a near future. Furthermore, two repositories linked to universities in Brazil and South Africa are the leaders in those emerging economies. Putting aside the leadership position, India and China are over and above the rest of the BRIC countries, meanwhile in the case of the CIVETS countries Indonesia has a relevant position.
