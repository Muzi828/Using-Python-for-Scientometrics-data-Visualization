A study of the structure and scientific activity of the most productive Spanish research teams in two biomedical subfields, Pharmacology Bi Pharmacy and Cardiovascular System (SCI), during the period 1990-93 was carried out through bibliometric indicators. The teams were characterized according to their size, production, productivity, research level and expected impact factor of their output, collaboration pattern and interdisciplinarity. Main differences between both subfields were analyzed and explained by their different clinical/basic character. The study was undertaken to identify structural or dynamic features of teams associated with good scientific performance.
