In this study some novel indicators and publication data resources are explored to study the dynamics of genomics research at three different levels: worldwide; national and at individual Research Centers. Our results indicate that the growth of genomics research worldwide seems to be stabilizing, whereas genomics research in the Netherlands aims at getting 'ready for the next step'. As we find differences in research dynamics at the level of individual Research Centers, governmental support in a 'next step' could take these differences into account. For this purpose, we introduce a general model of research dynamics and timing of research management, building on ideas of Price and Bonaccorsi. Based on this model a framework is presented to discuss steering options in relation to research dynamics. We apply this framework to Research Centers of the Netherlands Genomics Initiative (NGI) and discuss findings.
