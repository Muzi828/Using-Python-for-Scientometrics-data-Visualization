in this case study a first attempt was made to explore data on the Web for a certain period of time by using bibliometric methods for analysis. The period under investigation was between January 3, 1998 and June 7, 1998. An additional search was carried out on June 20, 1999. The terms used were "informetrics or informetric". The results show that substantial changes occurred to the "literature on the Web" on informetrics during this period. Three specific trends were observed: some documents disappeared, new ones were added and some underwent changes.
