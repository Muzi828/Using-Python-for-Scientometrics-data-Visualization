This paper is the third in a series on the flows       of influence at the interface between geoscience research and the exploration for and mining of nuclear fuels. It deals with the application of signal processing methods to research and industry indicators, with emphasis on time and frequency domain correlations and lap, and on growth modelling of the indicators using the special and general logistic models. The findings include the following: there was a strong interchange across the science-industry interface; quantitative methods. can establish the degree of correlation and the time periods in which these correlations mainly reside; also the timing of decisions to initiate exploration and research can be specified in this cue. A strategy of applying quantitative methods, history of science, and periodic analyses of the state of the industry to studies of science policy is suggested by this research.
