In this paper CITAN, the CITation ANalysis package for R statistical computing environment, is introduced. The main aim of the software is to support bibliometricians with a tool for preprocessing and cleaning bibliographic data retrieved from SciVerse Scopus and for calculating the most popular indices of scientific impact.
To show the practical usability of the package, an exemplary assessment of authors publishing in the fields of scientometrics and webometrics is performed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
