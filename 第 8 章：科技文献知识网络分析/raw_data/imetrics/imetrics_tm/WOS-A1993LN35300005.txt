Results are presented of a study covering 1986-91 of the scientific output of Latin American nations. The distribution of the output within the countries is shown: in most countries there is a high concentration in the national capital. The papers co-authored with scientists from other countries are also examined. There has been a notable rise in both the number and proportion of papers co-authored within the region, with the USA and Canada, and, especially, with the countries of the European Community, where a programme of International Scientific Co-operation, to promote just such links, has been active since the mid-1980s in many Latin American countries.
