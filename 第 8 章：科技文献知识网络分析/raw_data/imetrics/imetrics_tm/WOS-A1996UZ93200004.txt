Despite the various studies on international collaboration, we still know very little about other forms of scientific collaboration. The present paper looks at collaboration at a national level, more particularly between regions in a country. It is found that regional collaboration is very limited. In fact, international collaboration is three times more important than regional collaboration. This can be explained by the fact that the competition center in science is international rather than national.
