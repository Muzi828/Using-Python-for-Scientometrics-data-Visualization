This paper makes the assumption that Norwegian patenting in the US reflects a quasi-universe of Norwegian technological capabilities. Based on this assumption, the paper combines a "patent-bibliometrics" and a "technometrics" approach to study other relevant bodies of knowledge these capabilities build upon. In order to study interactions at the "science-technology-innovation interface", the paper maps the citation patterns that radiate from the patent population (1990-96) to other areas of technology (patent-citations) and to science-bases (citations to Non-Patent Literature or NPL). The study identifies important technology-technology links that involve machinery, process-engineering and chemical and significant science-technology links that involve pharmaceuticals and instruments.
