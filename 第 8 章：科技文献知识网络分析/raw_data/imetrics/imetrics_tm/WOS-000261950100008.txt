We have developed a way of describing the increase with time of the number of papers in a scientific field and apply it to a data base of about 2000 papers on symbolic logic published between 1666 and 1934. We find (a) a general exponential increase in the cumulative total number of papers, (b) oscillations around this due to the appearance of new ideas in the field and the time required for their full incorporation, and (c) exogenously caused fluctuations due to wars and other non-scientific events.
