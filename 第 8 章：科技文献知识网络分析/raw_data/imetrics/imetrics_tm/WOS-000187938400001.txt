After several decades of heavy research activity on English stemmers, Arabic morphological analysis techniques have become a popular area of research. The Arabic language is one of the Semitic languages; it exhibits a very systematic but complex morphological structure based on root-pattern schemes. As a consequence, survey of such techniques proves to be more necessary. The aim of this paper is to summarize and organize the information available in the literature in an attempt to motivate researchers to look into these techniques and try to develop more advanced ones. This paper introduces, classifies, and surveys Arabic morphological analysis techniques. Furthermore, conclusions, open areas, and future directions are provided at the end.
