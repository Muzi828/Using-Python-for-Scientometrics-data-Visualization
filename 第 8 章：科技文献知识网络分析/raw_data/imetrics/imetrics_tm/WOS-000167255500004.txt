Structured thesauri encode equivalent, hierarchical, and associative relationships and have been developed as indexing/retrieval tools. Despite the fact that these tools provide a rich semantic network of vocabulary terms, they are seldom employed for automatic query expansion (QE) activities. This article reports on an experiment that examined whether thesaurus terms, related to query in a specified semantic way (as synonyms and partial-synonyms (SYNs), narrower terms (NTs), related terms (RTs), and broader terms (BTs)), could be identified as having a more positive impact on retrieval effectiveness when added to a query through automatic QE, The research found that automatic QE via SYNs and NTs increased relative recall with a decline in precision that was not statistically significant, and that automatic QE via RTs and BTs increased relative recall with a decline in precision that was statistically significant, Recall-based and a precision-based ranking orders for automatic QE via semantically encoded thesauri terminology were identified, Mapping results found between enduser query terms and the ProQuest(R) Controlled Vocabulary (1997) (the thesaurus used in this study) are reported, end future research foci related to the investigation are discussed.
