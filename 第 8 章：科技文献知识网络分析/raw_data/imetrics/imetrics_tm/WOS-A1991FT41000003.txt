A recent extensive review of research in British universities has produced a research rating for each university department based primarily on peer review of the department's publications.  In this preliminary study, we compare these ratings with publication and citation data for the chemistry departments at two British universities.  The results underline the importance of the most productive researchers in departments.  This point is supported by citation data from a chemical engineering department.
