A bibliometric online technique is applied on data from the INSPEC bibliographic file to describe some aspects of Moravcsik's publication activity (co-authorship, source journals, etc.).  Separately, a co-occurrence method is used to represent the subject structure (the main topics and their links) of his papers in physics.  The principle underlying this method is to develop a network based on common appearances of classification subdivisions (headings) as well as of controlled terms in Moravcsik's document records.  The results, in the form of line and point graphs, give a global picture of Mike Moravcsik's research profile in physics.
