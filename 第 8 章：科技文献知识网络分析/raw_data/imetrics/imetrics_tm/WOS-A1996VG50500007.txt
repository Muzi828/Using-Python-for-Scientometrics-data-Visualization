An approach for evaluation of research is described that integrates output indicators of four stages downstream the innovation process: immediate, intermediate, pre- ultimate and ultimate outputs. Indexes of leading output indicators are constructed. The indexes are integrated cumulatively to form an overall index of key output indicators, which is the integrated figure of merit (IFM). Data for the indicators are obtained from records and key informants, and the indicators are grouped by normalized weights. The paper also discusses the limitations and the methodological, conceptual and political/organizational issues of such an approach to research evaluation.
