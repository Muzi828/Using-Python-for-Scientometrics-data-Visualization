In the past 30 years various scientometric analyses have provided input data for research policy objectives of research institutions in the Netherlands. In this article we discuss several pioneering studies performed on behalf of the research councils for physics (FOM) and technical sciences (STW), which have played an important role in the early development of scientometrics in this country. The motives for these studies, the results and the influence on research policy are discussed. Relations to present themes in scientometric investigations are drawn.
