Methods were developed to allow quality assessment of academic research in linguistics in all sub-disciplines. Data were obtained from samples of respondents from Flanders, the Netherlands, as well as a world-wide sample, evaluated journals, publishers, and scholars. Journals and publishers were ranked by several methods. First, we weighted the number of times journals or publishers were ranked as 'outstanding', 'good'. or 'occasionally/not at all good'. To reduce the influence of unduly positive or negative biases of respondents, the most extreme ratings were trimmed. A second weight reflects the (international) visibility of journals and publishers. Here, journals or publishers nominated by respondents from various countries or samples received a greater weight than journals or publishers nominated by respondents from one country or one sample only. Thirdly, a combined index reflects both quality and international visibility. Its use is illustrated on the output of scholars in linguistics. Limitations and potentials for application of bibliometric methods in output assessments are discussed.
