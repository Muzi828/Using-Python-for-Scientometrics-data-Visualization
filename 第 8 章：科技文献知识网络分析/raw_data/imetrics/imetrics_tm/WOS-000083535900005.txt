A significant portion of scientometrics research involves studies of relative citation rates to groups of citable items. This paper examines the relative citation rates to own-language as compared to foreign language materials. A simple probabilistic model of citation behavior is defined, which suggests a natural measure of relative citation rate. Unlike earlier indicators, our measure is independent of the size of the base population.
