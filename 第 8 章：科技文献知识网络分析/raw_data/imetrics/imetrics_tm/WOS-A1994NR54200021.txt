The Informetrics Research Group (CERESI/CNRS) was recently created by the Mission for Scientific and Technical Information and Communication of the CNRS. CERESI's goal is to study the impact of computer supported information exchanges on the social processes underlying the construction of scientific knowledge. A better understanding of this impact should help in designing and building scientific and technical information management systems. In this paper, we will focus on one aspect of our work: mapping science and technology in order to build dynamic representations of science and technology.
