The ability of g-index and h-index to discriminate between different types of scientists (low producers, big producers, selective scientists and top scientists) is analysed in the area of Natural Resources at the Spanish CSIC (WoS, 1994-2004). Our results show that these indicators clearly differentiate low producers and top scientists, but do not discriminate between selective scientists and big producers. However, g-index is more sensitive than h-index in the assessment of selective scientists, since this type of scientist shows in average a higher g-index/h-index ratio and a better position in g-index rankings than in the h-index ones. Current research suggests that these indexes do not substitute each other but that they are complementary.
