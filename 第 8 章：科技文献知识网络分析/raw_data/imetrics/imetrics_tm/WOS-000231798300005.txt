In this paper attempt has been made to study the engineering research scenario in ocean sector across the countries - globally. To understand the research dynamics, the articles appeared in Science Citation Index (SCI) database under Ocean Engineering category in the year 2000 were analyzed to visualize the structure of the field. USA and UK are the major producers - 62% of the total output contributed by them. The cooperation linkages between engineers, organizations, countries and journals were mapped. The causal linkages between the productivity function and the socio-economic imperatives of the production units were studied. 62% output in this sector goes to USA & UK. They are also toppers in collaboration centrality list. National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), USA; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), USA; National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), India are the most productive institutions. GDP explains only 36% of variance in productivity (R-2 = 0.36). M Longuethiggins and CC Mei are the most cited authors in the field. Co-citation maps of cited authors and cited journals throw light on the semantic structure of the field. Studies in wave mechanics and modeling of waves are the most important areas of research in Ocean Technology.
