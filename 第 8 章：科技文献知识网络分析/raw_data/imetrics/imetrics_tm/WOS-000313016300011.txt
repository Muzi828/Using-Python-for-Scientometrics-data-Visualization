Most biomedical journals accept original research articles in the form of "brief reports". We compared the citations to full papers versus brief reports in a sample of journals on Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, and Antimicrobial Agents. Brief reports were cited less often than full-size articles [regression coefficient: 10.94 (95 % CI: 5.19, 16.69)] even after adjustment for the journal's impact factor. Our findings may influence decisions of editors and authors regarding brief reports.
