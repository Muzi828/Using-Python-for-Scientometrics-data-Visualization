A new index - Relative Publication Growth (RPG) - was suggested for characterizing the annual increase of publications in different selected periods. It has been revealed that the mean citedness of papers ("Chance for Citedness") increases parallel with increasing RPG and growing mean number of references in papers. The number of citations attainable by a paper published in a given journal may be estimated by multiplying the resp. Journal Citedness Factor (JCF) with the Garfield Factor of the resp. journal. The JCF values may represent the aging of information whereas GF-s the potential frequency of citations.
