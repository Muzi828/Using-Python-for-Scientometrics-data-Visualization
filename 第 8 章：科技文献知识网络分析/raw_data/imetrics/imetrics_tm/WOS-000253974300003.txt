We apply the Google PageRank algorithm to assess the relative importance of all publications in the Physical Review family of journals from 1893 to 2003. While the Google number and the number of citations for each publication are positively correlated, outliers from this linear relation identify some exceptional papers or "gems" that are universally familiar to physicists.
