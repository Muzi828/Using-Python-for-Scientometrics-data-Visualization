Authorship studies in such disciplines as physics and economics show that with the passage of time there has been an increase in the number of authors per paper, indicating a trend toward more collaboration. In this study, a search was run on the Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts database to identify marine mammal science papers published from 1985 to 1993. A total of 1308 papers published in scientific journals was examined. There were weak but statistically significant trends in the increase in the number of authors per paper as well as in the number of multi-authored papers written by authors from different institutions, with the passage of time. Possible reasons for these results include the increasing specialization of researchers necessitating collaboration, more access to electronic means of communication, and more competition for research funds. Confounding factors in this analysis include the possibility that different journals have different publication patterns and regional vs. national/international journal differences.
