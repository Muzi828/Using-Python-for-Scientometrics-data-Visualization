The coverage of Indian S&T periodicals in SCI has been studied covering the period 1975-88. The study shows that coverage is rather poor due to a variety of reasons. Many of the Indian periodicals do not fulfil the criteria for getting covered in SCI. About 500 periodicals have been identified which are covered by at least one major indexing or abstracting service of the world. Total number of such periodicals is likely to be over 600. Slight improvement in the standard of these periodicals is likely to make many of them worthy of coverage by SCI.
