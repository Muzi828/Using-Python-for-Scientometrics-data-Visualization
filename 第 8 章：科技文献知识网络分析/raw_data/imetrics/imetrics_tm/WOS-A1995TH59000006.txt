A multisynchronous obsolescence study has been performed on two computing journals that publish on technical aspects of computer system management (networks and operating systems). This area of computer science is found to have a relatively high obsolescence rate (a median citation rate of four years). This rate is similar to that of fields in engineering and the technology-dependent ''hard'' sciences.
