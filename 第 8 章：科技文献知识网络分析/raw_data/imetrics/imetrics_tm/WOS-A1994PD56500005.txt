By use of the subject category ''Planetary Nebulae'' (PNe) in the semiannual volumes of Astronomy and Astrophysics Abstracts for the years 1986 to 1990, we statistically investigated items like the number of individuals with at least one paper concerning PNe (e.g. 331 in 1990), how this number is distributed among the 31 countries involved in PNe research (with the former USSR counted as one country), how the USA, Europe, and the remaining countries share the total number over 5 years (333, 317, and 283, respectively), etc. Furthermore, we give the number of publications, per individual and per year, in each country (The Netherlands is leading). We learned, that on the average there are 2.47 authors per PNe paper, and that the PNe researchers are producing 1.74 papers per year - if they publish at least once per year on PNe. In addition, we do not hesitate to give a list of names (the Top Ten), as far as their total number of papers on PNe are concerned. Last not least - do you have a guess how many individuals published at least one paper on PNe within these five years? There are 933.
