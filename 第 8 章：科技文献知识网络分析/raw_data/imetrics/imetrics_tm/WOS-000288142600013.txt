This comparative case study explores the impact of four influential practitioner-generated theories from the 1970s to the present in the separate domains of finance, military strategy, nursing, and theology, and it discusses why bibliometric research tends to overlook such "invisible" theories from practice, despite their increasing importance in many areas.The concept of the "practice field" as a site for not only the reception of theories into practice but also the production of practice theories themselves may prove useful.
