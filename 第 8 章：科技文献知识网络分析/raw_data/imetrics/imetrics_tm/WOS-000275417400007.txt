Our study evaluates results and impacts of the Framework Programs (FP) 5 and 6 in the Czech Republic. Publications resulting from the FP projects had 42% higher mean citation rate and 77% more EU-25 collaborations than the Czech standards. Teams participating in the FP are better-than-average, because citation rate of all their papers is 21% higher than the Czech standards. The most striking finding is the marked influence of FP on research direction. After the project start, the participating teams published papers in ten new fields in which they did not publish before the project. In 45 other fields, more than 200% increase of papers was observed.
