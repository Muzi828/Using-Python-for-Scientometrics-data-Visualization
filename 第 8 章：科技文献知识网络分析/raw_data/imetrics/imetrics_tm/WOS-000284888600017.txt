To assess the publication practices of editors in their own journals, we analysed the number of articles that Croatian editors published in the journals they edit. From 2005 to 2008, 256 decision-making editors of 180 journals published a total of 887 publications in their own journals. Out of these, 332 were relevant for their academic promotion. Only 18 editors published 5 or more articles in their own journals. A single journal had regulations for self-publishing in the instructions for authors. Although the majority of editors did not misuse their own journals for scientific publishing and academic promotion, there is a need for greater transparency of the declaration and management of editorial conflict of interest in academic and scholarly journals.
