The Brazilian scientific production and its international impact increased considerably in the last 10 years. This increase occurred in spite of a reduction in the resources for science in the same period. The data show that the explanation for this apparent paradox lies in the active process of international and national collaboration which increased in this same period. Collaborative work was supported by several programs of the Brazilian agencies. Advantages and possible drawbacks of the intensification of scientific collaboration for the Brazilian science are discussed.
