This paper studies the role and effects of user-producer interaction (UPI) in the production of Web sites. The results of two empirical studies, one from a producer perspective and one from a user perspective, are presented. It is concluded that using UPI in the development of informative Web sites for a large public is a risky process, because it is hard to identify and define the most targeted users and their particular needs. The implications of these results are discussed.
