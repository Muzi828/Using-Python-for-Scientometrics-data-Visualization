The present study examines that a research and development (R&D) performance creation process conforms to the stepwise chain structure of a typical R&D logic model regarding a national technology innovation R&D program. Based on a series of successive binary logistic regression models newly proposed in the present study, a sample of n = 929 completed government-sponsored R&D projects was analyzed empirically. Sensitivity analyses are summarized where the performance creation success probability is predicted for some key R&D performance factors.
