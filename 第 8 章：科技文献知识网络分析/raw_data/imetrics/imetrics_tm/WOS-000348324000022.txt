This paper uses a bibliometric analysis method to probe into the evolution of China's science and technology policies from 1949 to 2010, and the roles of core government agencies in policy-making. We obtained 4,707 Chinese S&T policies from GDIS, a Chinese public policy database provided by Tsinghua University. Co-word analysis and network analysis were applied in mapping the topics of S&T policies and collaboration among the agencies, while citation analysis was applied to assess the influence of S&T policies. Findings include: first, the focus of Chinese S&T policies is mainly on applied research and industrialization, rather than basic research; second, more and more government agencies are involved in making S&T policies, but collaboration efforts are not significantly increasing; last but not least, the influence of different S&T policies is determined by the administrative ranking of the policy-making agencies responsible for drafting those policies.
