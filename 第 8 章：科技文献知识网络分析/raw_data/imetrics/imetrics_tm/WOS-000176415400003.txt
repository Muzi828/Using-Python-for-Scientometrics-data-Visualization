Counts of links the websites of Australasian universities were calculated from the output of a specially designed crawler that covered universities in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. These figures were compared to those from the commercial search engines AltaVista and AllTheWeb. Web Impact Factors (WIFs) for Australasian universities were then calculated by dividing link counts from the three countries by academic staff numbers at each target university. WIFs were compared with each other and also with a conventional measure of research output for Australia. It was discovered that the crawler-generated link counts were roughly proportional to those from AltaVista and AllTheWeb for Australia, albeit with some outliers in the data. WIFs correlated quite well with research output for Australia, but the relationship was not clear enough to be able to differentiate between the characters of the WIFs from the three different sources. However, a new measurement introduced, the normalised propensity to link, suggests that the New Zealand university web is more insular than that of Australia.
