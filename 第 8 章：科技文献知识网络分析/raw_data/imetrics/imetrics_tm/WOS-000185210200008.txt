Little data are available that can help librarians solve issues surrounding print versus online journals management, including ascertaining when print journals are no longer needed. This study examines the short-term effects of online availability on the use of print chemistry journals. The Duke University Chemistry Library gained access to Elsevier titles via ScienceDirect in February 2000. By comparing reshelving data for the print journals from 1999, 2000, and 2001, this study identifies the short-term changes in journals use that can be attributed to the introduction of ScienceDirect. In the first two years after ScienceDirect was introduced, use of print journals nearly halved. The diminished use of the print collection has important implications for collection management in sci-tech libraries.
