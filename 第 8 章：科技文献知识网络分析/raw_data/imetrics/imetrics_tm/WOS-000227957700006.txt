Nimble competitors competing in a dynamic global marketspace increasingly characterize the current environment faced by many organizations. Providing the organization's knowledge workers with the tools and technology to mine information and generate insights has become a key issue facing organizations. In this study we investigate the potential combined impact of the use of organizational decision models and competitive intelligence tool proficiency on knowledge creation and strategic use of information competence. Regression analysis results show significant main and interaction effects of the organizational decision models and competitive intelligence tool proficiency on four identified factors of knowledge creation and strategic use of information competence: pattern discovery, strategy appraisal, insight generation, and solution formulation. Organizational implications and future research directions are discussed.
