Prior research has identified specific factors that hinder growth of teledensity in developing countries and specific strategies used to overcome such limitations both in Latin America and in Sub-Saharan Africa. Prior research also has reported on the perceptions that telecommunications stakeholders have on how various strategies can inform and assist in the enhancement of teledensity in each of the two continental regions. This study fills a gap in the literature by investigating similarities and differences in the telecommunication stakeholders' perspectives of specific strategies used to address teledensity limitations in Latin America as well as in Sub-Saharan Africa. Independent samples of survey participants (Latin America's and Sub-Saharan Africa's telecommunications stakeholders) analyzed the strategies. Using appropriate statistical procedures, we examined these stakeholders' perceptions to find areas of commonality and difference in their respective perspectives on the effectiveness of selected strategies. Qualitative comments to support the stakeholders' responses are reported, together with future research implications.
