Firms are increasingly dependent on networks and network visibility for innovation. Bibliometric impact can be regarded as a measure of a firm's visibility in knowledge-producing networks and may explain why companies publish their results. However, this visibility varies across disciplines. This paper examines publications produced by Danish companies in 1996, 1998 and 2000 to show how citation and collaboration patterns relate in different disciplines. The main findings are that for disciplines characterized by international collaboration and many authors per paper, international collaboration results in a greater number of citations. National collaboration does not, however, seem to make any difference to citation impact in industrial research. In disciplines where multinational collaboration and multi-authorship is uncommon, no clear picture of impact patterns can be obtained. By extension, this research may provide knowledge on how citations of papers in scientific journals can be used as a potential window to scientific networks for firms.
