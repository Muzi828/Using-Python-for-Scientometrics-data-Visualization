Pichappan's formulation of the Discipline-Contribution Score (DCS) in the identification of core disciplinary journals is applied to social science literature. Modifications are made to Pichappan's method to cater for problems associated with low citation counts. Further analysis is undertaken to verify Pichappan's claims concerning the size-independent nature of the DCS score. The proposed modified formulation of the DCS calculation facilitates research into small research fields, and those characterised by low citation rates. The modified equation is tested on business and management literature.
