A study of the production of scientific papers, co-authorships, and R&D-expenditures shows that science is becoming more equally distributed among the OECD-countries. Papers in the journal Science are more unequally distributed than papers in Science Citation Index as a whole or the distribution of R&D-investments. Scientific collaboration, is a major factor affecting the distribution of scientific papers.
