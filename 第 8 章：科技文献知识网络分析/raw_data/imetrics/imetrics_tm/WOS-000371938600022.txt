This study uses cluster analysis as a tool for mapping diversity of publication patterns in the social sciences and humanities (SSH). By algorithmic clustering of 1828 senior authors affiliated with 16 disciplines at five universities in Flanders, Belgium, based on the similarity of their publication patterns during 2000-2011, we distinguish two broad publication styles, both of which are present within each discipline. We conclude that diversity in SSH publication patterns cuts across disciplinary boundaries. Cluster analysis shows promise for application in research evaluation for the SSH. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
