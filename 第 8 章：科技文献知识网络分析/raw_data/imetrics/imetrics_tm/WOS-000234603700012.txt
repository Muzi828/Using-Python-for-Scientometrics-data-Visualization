We present a new kind of statistical analysis of science and technical information (STI) in the Web context. We propose a battery of indicators about Web users, used bibliographic records and e-commercial transactions. In addition, we introduce two Web usage factors and we give an overview of the co-usage analysis. For these tasks, we present a computer-based system, called Miri@d, which produces descriptive statistical information about Web users' searching behaviour, and what is effectively used from a free-access digital bibliographical database.
