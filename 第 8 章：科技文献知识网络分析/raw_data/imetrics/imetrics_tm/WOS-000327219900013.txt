This article describes an analysis of keywords which was aimed at revealing publication patterns in the field of renewable energy, including the temporal evolution of its different research lines over the last two decades. To this end, we first retrieved the records of the sample, then we processed the keywords to resolve their obvious problems of synonymy and to limit the study to those most used. The final results showed a clear increase in scientific production related to alternative energies, and a structure corresponding to five major clusters which, at a finer level of resolution, were decomposed into 22. We analyzed the structure of the clusters and their temporal evolution, paying particular attention to uncovering the bursty periods of the different lines of research.
