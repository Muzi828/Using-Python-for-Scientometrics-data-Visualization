In recent years, numerous studies have been published which have used bibliometric data to look at collaborations in research. This study presents a proposal with which the topical connections of the institutions of an organization can be investigated through analysis of co-authorships, direct citation links, and co-citations. Based on various bibliometric data sets for an organization whose institutions are used as an example, this study illustrates the possibility of comparing the self-perception of institutions of this organization (co-authorships, direct citation links) with a view to (possible) mutual collaboration with the external perception (co-citations). This comparison is made firstly for the whole organization with the aid of network graphs; secondly, the comparison is presented in a table for a specific institution and its (possible) collaborations in the organization. Particularly the tabular breakdown of the links between the institutions can provide concrete indications of possible further collaboration between the institutions which have not yet manifested themselves in co-authorships.
