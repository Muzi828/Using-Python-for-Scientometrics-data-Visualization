In this contribution we consider one particular node in a network, referred to as the ego. We combine Zipf lists and ego measures to put forward a conceptual framework for characterizing this particular node. In this framework we unify different forms of h-indices, in particular the h-degree, introduced in the literature. Similarly, different forms of the g-index, the a-index and the R-index are unified. We focus on the pure mathematical and logical concepts, referring to the existing literature for practical examples. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
