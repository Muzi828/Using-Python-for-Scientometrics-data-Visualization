Social network analysis is an important research tradition in structural sociology and has contributed much to our understanding of inter and intra organizational relations. Of particular significance is the contribution of social network analysis to the definition of community. Communities, whether traditional or scientific, can be effectively thought of as a series of positions and roles. This paper proposes four hypotheses about a select group of management scholars (laureates) and the network ties that connect them. Laureates were asked to identify individuals who had influenced their intellectual development and work in the management discipline. An invisible college in the traditional sense did not exist but rather a complex series of intellectual neighborhoods were identified. These neighborhoods, as contrasted to true communities or colleges were small, uncoordinated, and fragmented.
