In this article, the authors introduce two citation-based approaches to facilitate a multidimensional evaluation of 39 selected management journals. The first is a refined application of PageRank via the differentiation of citation types. The second is a form of mathematical manipulation to identify the roles that the selected management journals play. Their findings reveal that Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management Review, and Administrative Science Quarterly are the top three management journals, respectively. They also discovered that these three journals play the role of a knowledge hub in the domain. Finally, when compared with Journal Citation Reports (Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA), their results closely match expert opinions.
