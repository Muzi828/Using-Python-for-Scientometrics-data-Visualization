The Triple Helix (TH) model and its indicators are typically used for exploring university-industry-government relations prevalent in knowledge-based economies. However, this exploratory study extends the TH model, together with webometric analysis, to the musical industry to explore the performance of social hubs from the perspective of entropy and the Web. The study investigates and compares two social hubs-Daegu and Edinburgh-from the perspective of musicals by using data obtained through two search engines (Naver.com and Bing.com). The results indicate that although Daegu is somewhat integrated into the local musical industry, it is not yet fully embedded in the international musical industry, even though it is international in scope. In terms of social events (i.e., musicals), unlike Daegu, Edinburgh is fully integrated into both the local and international musical industries and attracts diverse domains over the Internet.
