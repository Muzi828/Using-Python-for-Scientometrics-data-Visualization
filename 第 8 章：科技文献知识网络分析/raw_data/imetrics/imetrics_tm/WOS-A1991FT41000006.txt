Results are given of an analysis of the scientific papers describing work carried out under two European Community research programmes, in biotechnology and environmental chemicals.  They were shown to be more multinational in their authorship than other papers in the same journals, and as a consequence, more frequently cited in the 5 years following publication.  The citation rates peak early for the biotechnology papers suggesting that effective measures have been taken to disseminate the results of the work to other scientists so that they have become aware of them earlier than usual.
