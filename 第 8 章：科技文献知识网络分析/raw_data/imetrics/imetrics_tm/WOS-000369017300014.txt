The purpose of this study was to determine whether authorship order-as measured by first author publications, citations to first author publications, and the first author h-index-plays a significant role in scholarly productivity. Scholarly productivity was assessed in this study with publications from 2011 to 2014 and citations to these publications as indexed by the Thomson Web of Science. Using a correlational design, a group-level analysis of 36 Ph.D.-granting departments of criminology and criminal justice revealed that ratings from a U.S. News & World Report (USN&WR) survey correlated significantly better with aggregate program first author publications than with aggregate program total publications, although citations to first author publications and the first author h-index failed to correlate significantly better with the USN&WR than citing articles to total publications and the total publication h-index, respectively. An individual-level correlational analysis of all 228 full professors from 44 programs offering a Ph.D. in criminology/criminal justice showed that time until promotion to full professor displayed a significantly stronger inverse correlation with the number of first author publications, the number of citations to first author publications, and the first author h-index than with the total number of publications, the number of citing articles to total publications, and the total publication h-index, respectively. Hence, at both the group and individual levels first author publications and at the individual level citations to first author publications and the first author h-index provided a better estimate of scholarly productivity than their respective total publication counterparts.
