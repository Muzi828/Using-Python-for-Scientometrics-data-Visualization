Identifying core technologies and emerging technologies is essential for formulating national technology strategies and policies for pursuing technological competitive advantage. This study presents a quantitative method for identifying core technologies and emerging technologies in the Taiwan technological innovation system. The objective was to gain an overview of technological development in the country by analyzing patent citation networks and by identifying five core technologies and emerging technologies in Taiwan based on United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patents granted to Taiwan during 1997-2008. The findings indicate the most appropriate management of technology and innovation and the best patent strategy and technology policy that the Taiwan government should pursue. Research institutes, industries and academia are also given research directions for choosing the technologies in which they should invest resources in order to strengthen the Taiwan technological innovation system and to increase its competitive advantage in global technology.
