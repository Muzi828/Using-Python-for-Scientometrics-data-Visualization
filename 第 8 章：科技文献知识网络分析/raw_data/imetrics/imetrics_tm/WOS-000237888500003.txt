We assessed the contribution of Brazilian limnologists (freshwater ecologists) in international journals in the period 1970-2004. Brazilian contribution was low and regular in the 1970's, but increased steeply after 1980 with no signs of stabilization until the present. Articles authored by Brazilians tend to be less cited than articles authored by non-Brazilians, although this difference is reduced in co-authored articles with international researchers. Brazilian articles are not distributed homogenously among the sub-areas of Limnology, but present some biases that can be explained by intellectual legacy. Brazil has invested since the 1970's in establishing postgraduate courses in Brazil and in the last years has turned the focus to a better qualification of these courses. We believe these are the main reasons for the conspicuous development of Brazilian Limnology.
