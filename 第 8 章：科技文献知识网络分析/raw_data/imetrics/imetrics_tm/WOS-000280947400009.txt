We report here a simple method to identify the 'emerging topics' in life sciences. First, the keywords selected from MeSH terms on PubMed by filtering the terms based on their increment rate of the appearance, and, then, were sorted into groups dealing with the same topics by 'co-word' analysis. These topics were defined as 'emerging topics'. The survey of the emerging keywords with high increment rates of appearance between 1972 to 2006 showed that emerging topics changed dramatically year by year, and that the major shift of the topics occurred in the late 90s; the topics that cover technical and conceptual aspects in molecular biology to the more systematic '-omics'-related and nanoscience-related aspects. We further investigated trends in emerging topics within various sub-fields in the life sciences.
