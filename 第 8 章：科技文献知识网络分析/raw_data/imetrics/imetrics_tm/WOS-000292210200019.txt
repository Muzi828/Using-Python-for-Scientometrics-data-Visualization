The notion of 'core documents', first introduced in the context of co-citation analysis and later re-introduced for bibliographic coupling, refers to the representation of the core of a publication set according to given criteria. In the present study, the notion of core documents is extended to the combination of citation-based and textual links. It is shown that core documents defined this way can be used to represent and describe document clusters and topics at different levels of aggregation. Methodology is illustrated using the example of two ISI Subject Categories selected from applied and social sciences.
