Certain similarities between the types of data reported in retrospective citation analyses and lifetime/survival/reliability models are noted. Graphical techniques much used in reliability analyses are exploited to throw further light on observed citation age distributions and these are then compared and contrasted with previously reported studies. These simple techniques allow systematic departures of empirical data from assumed theoretical models to be highlighted and the models to be compared.
