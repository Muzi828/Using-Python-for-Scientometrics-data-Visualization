Major findings are reported of a survey of scientists and engineers awarded an EC Training Fellowship between 1966 and 1988.  472 former fellows and 140 renonces, i.e. declining the fellowship awarded, report about academic experiences in another EC country and administrative issues of the fellowship as well as subsequent careers.  The article places special emphasis on the 12 percent of former fellows from less favoured regions of the European community.  They turn out to regard the fellowship more favourably than fellows from advanced regions, but would prefer other options, if they could decide again.
