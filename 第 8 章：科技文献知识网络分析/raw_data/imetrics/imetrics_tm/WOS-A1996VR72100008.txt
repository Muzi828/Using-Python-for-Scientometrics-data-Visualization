This study analyses activities in new biotechnology in food science and technology using bibliometric methods. Multidimensional scaling is used to visualise the structure of the field as represented by scientific literature and patent applications. For the science as well for the technology side increasing activities in the field were found. The specialisation analysis shows above average specialisation at the science and the technology side of the EU member countries (except for Germany) as well as for the USA. Within the EU also less developed countries intensified their R&D activities. At the science side aspects of food safety and quality are highly relevant. These topics are also tackled at the technology side but, compared to the science side these sub-fields seem to be still more isolated within the structure of the field. Structural differences between the science and the technology side partly may be explained by special features of the patent law in biotechnology.
