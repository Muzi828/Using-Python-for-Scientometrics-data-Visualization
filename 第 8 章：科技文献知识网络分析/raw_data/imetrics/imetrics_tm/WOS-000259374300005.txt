This study examines the relative efficiency of the R&D process across a group of 22 developed and developing countries using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The R&D technical efficiency is examined using a model with patents granted to residents as an output and gross domestic expenditure on R&D and the number of researchers as inputs. Under CRS (Constant Returns to Scale), Japan, the Republic of Korea and China are found to be efficient, whereas under the VRS (Variable Returns to Scale) framework, Japan, the Republic of Korea, China, India, Slovenia and Hungary are found to be efficient. The emergence of some of the developing nations on the efficiency frontier indicates that these nations can also serve as benchmarks for their efficient use of R&D resources. The inefficiency in the R&D resource usage highlighted by this study indicates the underlying potential that can be tapped for the development and growth of nations.
