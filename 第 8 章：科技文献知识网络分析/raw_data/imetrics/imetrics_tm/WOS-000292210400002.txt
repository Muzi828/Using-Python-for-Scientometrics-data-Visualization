If we have two information production processes with the same h-index, random removal of items causes one system to have a higher h-index than the other system while random removal of sources causes the opposite effect. In a Lotkaian framework we prove formulae for the h-index in case of random removal of items and in case of random removal of sources. In conclusion, we warn for the use of the h-index in case of incomplete data sets.
