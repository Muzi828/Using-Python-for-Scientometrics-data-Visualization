Annotations, in the form of markings and comments on the text, are often part of scholarly work. Digital platforms increasingly allow these annotations to be shared in group and public environments. To explore scholars' current behavior and attitudes toward shared annotations, semistructured interviews with 20 doctoral students were conducted. The findings suggest that sociocognitive processes are integral to scholars' creation and use of shared annotations. However, although scholars clearly support creating and using shared annotations, several sociocognitive hurdles have hampered adoption of scholarly shared annotation systems. This article discusses common themes emerging from the findings and relates them to research on shared annotations.
