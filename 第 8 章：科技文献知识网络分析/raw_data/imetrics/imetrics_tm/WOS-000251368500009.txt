The fractions of single-authored papers in four science fields (astronomy, physics, chemistry, and biology) were determined at five-year intervals during 1975-2005. In each case the distribution is best fitted with an exponential function that never reaches zero, implying that single-authored papers will continue to be published in the foreseeable future. This is contrary to the prediction that they would become extinct.
