Using the concepts of h- core and h- tail, shape descriptors and shape centroids, k-index and k ' - index, dynamic measures are probed, with practical data in the fields of Physics and sociology. It is revealed that there are obvious differences between natural sciences ( Physics, particles & fields) and social sciences ( sociology) when c-descriptor, h- core centroid and index are applied as dynamic measures, while few differences exist when using t-descriptor, h- tail centroid and k ' - index, following a time span from 1 to 10 years.
