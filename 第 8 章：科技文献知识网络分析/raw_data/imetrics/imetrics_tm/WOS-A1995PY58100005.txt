The scientific productivity, measured as number of publication credits per year, of 105 BS, MS and PhD degree holders at the authors' institution - a nonprofit international fisheries research organization based in Manila - was studied.  All authored and edited items produced by these staff, from 1978 to 1993, presently published or in press were considered, and weights assigned depending on document type, number of pages, and rank of the name in cases of multiple authorship or editorship.  The staff's output of conference papers and technical reports outweighted contributions to the primary (journal) literature.  Predictors of productivity were position/salary, education, and age.  However, a large unexplained variance remained, suggesting that individual factors largely determine productivity.
