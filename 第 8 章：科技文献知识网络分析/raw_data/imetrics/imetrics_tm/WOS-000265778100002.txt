We present an application of the h-index in a context which does not include publications or citations. Rankings of library classification categories using the h-, g-and R-index are shown to be statistically equivalent. Moreover these indices seem to have the same discriminating power, as measured by the Gini concentration index. We further present best fitting Zipf-Mandelbrot functions for the h-distributions of classifications in different libraries.
