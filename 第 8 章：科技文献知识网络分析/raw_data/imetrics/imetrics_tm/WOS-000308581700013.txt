In the present work we introduce a modification of the h-index for multi-authored papers with contribution based author name ranking. The modified h-index is denoted by h(mc)-index. It employs the framework of the h(m)-index, which in turn is a straightforward modification of the Hirsch index, proposed by Schreiber. To retain the merit of requiring no additional rearrangement of papers in the h(m)-index and in order to overcome its shortage of benefiting secondary authors at the expense of primary authors, h(mc)-index uses combined credit allocation (CCA) to replace fractionalized counting in the h(m)-index. The h(m)-index is a special form of h(mc)-index and fits for papers with equally important authors or alphabetically ordered authorship. There is a possibility of an author of lower contribution to the whole scientific community obtaining a higher h(mc)-index. Rational h(mc)-index, denoted by h(mcr)-index, can avoid it. A fictitious example as a model case and two empirical cases are analyzed. The correlations of the h(mcr)-index with the h-index and its several variants considering multiple co-authorship are inspected with 30 researchers' citation data. The results show that the h(mcr)-index is more reasonable for authors with different contributions. A researcher playing more important roles in significant work will obtain higher h(mcr)-index.
