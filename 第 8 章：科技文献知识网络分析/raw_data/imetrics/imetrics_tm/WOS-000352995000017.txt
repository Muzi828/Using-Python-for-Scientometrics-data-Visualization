The aim of this study was to analyse the scientific productivity of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) in viticulture and oenology through bibliometric analyses of articles in the Science Citation Index Expanded database for the period 1993-2012. A total of 1067 research articles were published in 363 domestic and international journals. We highlight important growth during the mentioned period in the published research papers, particularly in China and Brazil over the last 5 years. Papers have been published in numerous journals in a number of subject areas, such as Revista Brasileira de Fruticultura and Pesquisa Agropecuaria Brasileira, which are the most productive among the BRIC countries. A social network analysis of collaboration between each of the four BRIC countries was also performed.
