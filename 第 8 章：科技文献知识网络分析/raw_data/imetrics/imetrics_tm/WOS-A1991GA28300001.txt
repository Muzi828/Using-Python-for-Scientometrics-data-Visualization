The goals of the evaluation of the R & D programmes of the Commission of the European Communities is to assess, beside scientific and technical achievements, the added value due to the implementation of these activities at European level.  This requires the development of techniques different from those normally used for the measurement of scientific output.  In particular a number of indicators have been developed to assess international cooperation promoted by EC programmes and the resulting economic and industrial impact.
