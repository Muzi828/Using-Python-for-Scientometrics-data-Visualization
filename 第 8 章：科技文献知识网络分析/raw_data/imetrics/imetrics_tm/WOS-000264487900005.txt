In recent issues of the ISSI Newsletter, Egghe [2006a] proposed the g-index and Kosmulski [2006] the h(2)-index, both claimed to be improvements on the original h-index proposed by Hirsch [2005]. The aim of this paper is to investigate the inter-relationships between these measures and also their time dependence using the stochastic publication/citation model proposed by Burrell [1992, 2007a]. We also make some tentative suggestions regarding the relative merits of these three proposed measures.
