The present study is part of an ongoing project on clustering European research institutions according to their publication profiles. Using hierarchical clustering eight clusters have been found the optimum solution for the classification. Aim of the present study is a structural analysis for the evaluation of research performance of specialised and multidisciplinary institutions. A breakdown by subject fields is used to characterise field-specific peculiarities of individual clusters by bibliometric indicators and to allow comparison within the same and among different clusters. Finally, benchmarks can then be used to study national research performance on basis of the institutional classification.
