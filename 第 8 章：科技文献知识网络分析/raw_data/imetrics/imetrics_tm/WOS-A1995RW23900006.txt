In this study we have focused on the problem of mapping the dynamics of co-word-matrices from subsequent time periods. Methods for mapping dynamics are important for following trends in research. We have explored the possibilities of a three way multidimensional scaling method, INDSCAL. We are especially interested to find relations between adverse drug reactions and other words in co-word-matrices from a medical field. Second we want to explore whether the relations between adverse drug reactions and other words have changed in subsequent time periods. The results show that INDSCAL can be a useful tool for mapping dynamics.
