The paper explores the possibility of using a new variable represented by the number of collaborators per author as a substitute for the number of papers in Lotka's distribution to predict the productivity strata. On the basis of a case study in theoretical population genetics it is concluded that the number of collaborators per author has not proved to be a good substitute in the Lotka's distribution, which is in contrast to Qin's results.
