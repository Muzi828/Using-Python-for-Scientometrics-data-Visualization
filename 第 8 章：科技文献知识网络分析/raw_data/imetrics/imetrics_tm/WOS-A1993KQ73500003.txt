1081 otorhinolaryngological articles originating from departments in the British Isles, published in 8 leading English language speciality journals from 1985-1989 were analysed to determine author and content trends. Articles were classified as clinical investigative, laboratory based, case report or review/editorial. The institution of origin, total number of authors and identity of the first three were recorded. There is evidence of an increase in published British otolaryngological research and in the extent of researcher collaboration.
