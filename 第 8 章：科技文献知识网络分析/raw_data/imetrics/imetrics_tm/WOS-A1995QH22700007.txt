The structure of R & D in biotechnology is analysed using co-classification analysis of joint subject heading assignments in Derwent BIOTECHNOLOGY ABSTRACTS and subject profile analysis of 44 highly productive biotechnology-intensive organizations whose patents and publications are indexed therein.  A Pathfinder Network Analysis reveals two distinct foci in biotechnology R & D - fermentation and genetic engineering - each linked to relevant products and secondary processes.  Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis identified 5 major groupings of companies, research institutes, and patent-holding organizations arranged along two dimensions - industrial fermentation processes vs genetic engineering and biomedical vs non-biomedical R & D.
