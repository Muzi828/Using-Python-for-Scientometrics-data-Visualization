The paper analyses the citations to 1733 publications published during 1970-1999 by the Chemistry Division at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, using Science Citation Index 1982-2003 as the source data. The extent of citations received, in terms of the number of citations per paper, yearwise break up of citations, domainwise citations, self-citations and citations by others, diachronous self-citation rate, citing authors, citing institutions, highly cited papers, the categories of citing documents, citing journals and distribution of citations among them etc. are determined. During 1982-2003 chemistry Division publications have received a total of 11041 citations. The average number of citations per year was 501.86. The average number of citations per publication was 6.37. The highest number of citations received were 877 in 2001. The citation rate was peaked during 1990-2003 as maximum 9145 (82.82%) citations were received during the period. Total self-citations were 3716 (33.66%) and citations by others were 7325 (66.34%). Mean diachronous self-citation rate was 36.16. Citation time lag was zero for 144 (15.52%) papers and one year for 350 (37.72%) papers. Single authored publications (168) have received 456 (4.13%) citations and 1565 multi-authored publications have received 10585 (95.87%) citations. The core citing authors were: J. P. Mittal (695) followed by V. K. Jain (524), H. Mohan (471), T. Mukherjee (307), R. M Iyer (253), H. Pal (251), J. V. Yakhmi (211), A. V. Sapre (174), D. K. Palit (161), N. M. Gupta (128), and S. K. Kulshrestha (116). Citation life cycles of four highly cited papers was discussed. The core journals citing Chemistry Division publications were: J. Phys. Chem.-A (436 citations), Chem. Phys. Lett. (372), J. Phys. Chem. (355), J. Chem. Phys. (353), J. Organomet. Chem. (285), J. Phys. Chem.-B (279), J. Photochem. Photobiol.-A (263), Langmuir (245), J. Am. Chem. Soc. (226), Physica-C (225), Radiat. Phys. Chem. (217), Inorg. Chem. (215) and Indian J. Chem.-A (207).
