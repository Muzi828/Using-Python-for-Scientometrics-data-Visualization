A model of browsing-based conceptual information retrieval is proposed employing two different types of dictionaries, a global dictionary and a local dictionary. A global dictionary with the authorized terms is utilized to capture the commonly acknowledgeable conceptual relation between a query and a document by replacing their keywords with the dictionary terms. The documents are ranked by the conceptual closeness to a query, and are arranged in the form of a user's personal digital library, or pDL. In a pDL a user can browse the arranged documents based on a suggestion about which documents are worth examining. This suggestion is made by the information in a local dictionary that is organized so as to reflect a user's interest and the association of keywords with the documents. Experiments for testing the retrieval performance of utilizing the two types of dictionaries were also performed using standard test collections.
