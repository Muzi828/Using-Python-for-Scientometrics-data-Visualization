Extensive citation analysis with the Science Citation Index (SCI) has become possible through expanded search capabilities introduced by STN International a few years ago. STN enhanced its retrieval language with some important features, originally developed for statistical analysis of patents. Most important are an expanded select command and several functions to list the search results. The publications to be evaluated may be selected either in the SCI, or in a number of other bibliographic databases offered by the host. With the help of these features, the basic methods to appropriately measure the impact of scientific activities are demonstrated. Furthermore, possible shortcomings as well as the risks when interpreting the results of such studies are discussed.
