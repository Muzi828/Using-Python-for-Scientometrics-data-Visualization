In this paper, we present several modifications of the classical PageRank formula adapted for bibliographic networks. Our versions of PageRank take into account not only the citation but also the co-authorship graph. We verify the viability of our algorithms by applying them to the data from the DBLP digital library and by comparing the resulting ranks of the winners of the ACM E. F. Codd Innovations Award. Rankings based on both the citation and co-authorship information turn out to be "better" than the standard PageRank ranking.
