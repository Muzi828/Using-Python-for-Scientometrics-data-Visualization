Based on the citation data of journals covered by the China Scientific and Technical Papers and Citations Database (CSTPCD), we obtained aggregated journal-journal citation environments by applying routines developed specifically for this purpose. Local citation impact of journals is defined as the share of the total citations in a local citation environment, which is expressed as a ratio and can be visualized by the size of the nodes. The vertical size of the nodes varies proportionally to a journal's total citation share, while the horizontal size of the nodes is used to provide citation information after correction for the within-journal (self-) citations. In the "citing" environment, the equivalent of the local citation performance can also be considered as a citation activity index. Using the "citing" patterns as variables one is able to map how the relevant journal environments are perceived by the collective of authors of a journal, while the "cited" environment reflects the impact of journals in a local environment. In this study, we analyze citation impacts of three Chinese journals in mathematics and compare local citation impacts with impact factors. Local citation impacts reflect a journal's status and function better than (global) impact factors. We also found that authors in Chinese journals prefer international instead of domestic ones as sources for their citations.
