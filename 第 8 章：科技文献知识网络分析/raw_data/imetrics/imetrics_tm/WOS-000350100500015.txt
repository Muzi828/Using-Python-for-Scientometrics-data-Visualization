This article examines whether Sister Nivedita (1867-1911) played any role in the writing of the articles and books by J. C. Bose (1858-1937), an Indian scientist, during their long period of association (1898-1911). Here, the writings of J.C. Bose are studied from this perspective. It may be noted that the relation between Bose and Nivedita was personal in nature. Three important style markersfunction words, punctuation marks, and usage of words are used to trace the changes in Bose's writing style, if any. The results show that during the association between Bose and Nivedita, Bose's style of writing changed considerably in comparison to the earlier period when they did not know each other. It shows Nivedita helped Bose in preparing his journal articles and books. The results reveal a distinct change in Bose's writing style after his meeting with Nivedita. This is reflected in his changing pattern of usage of these three stylistic features. Bose slowly moved back towards his original style of writing after Nivedita's death, but his later works still carried Nivedita's influence.
