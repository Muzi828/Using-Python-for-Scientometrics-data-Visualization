This paper attempts to reveal the characteristics of high activity areas of world research in Physics. "Frontier areas"-areas of high activity and areas of low activity are identified. Research activities in "Frontier areas" for twenty six countries (major countries) contributing maximum research output in Physics are analyzed for two time periods (1990 & 1995). The main objective of this study is to reveal the areas of research priorities, trends, gaps and similarity of research efforts of major countries in these "frontier" areas. Key countries in these areas in both the time periods are identified. Multivariate Scaling Algorithm is applied to the countries and fields in each time period, and also simultaneously to understand the relationship between countries and fields and the dynamics of change in research priorities. Results and implications of this study for policy research is highlighted.
