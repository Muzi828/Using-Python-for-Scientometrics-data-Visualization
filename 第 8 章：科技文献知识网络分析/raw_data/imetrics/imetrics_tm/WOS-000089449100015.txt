Bibliometric analyses of research in developing countries are interesting for various reasons. The situation of Cuba is rather exceptional. The Cuban Journal of Agricultural Science (CJAS) is the only Cuban research journal, indexed by the Institute of Scientific information's Web of Science (WoS). We explore the possibilities of a citation analysis for Cuban research publications in general and for those in CJAS in particular. For the period 1988-1999, we find that this journal represents 14% of Cuban research publications. cited in the WoS. We remark that the number of self citations is relatively high and even increases since 1995, The results are classified by disciplines and we use a co-citation matrix to discuss the different observed citation patterns.
