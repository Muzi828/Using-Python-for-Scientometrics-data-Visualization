We investigated the distribution of citations included in documents labeled by the ISI as "editorial material" and how they contribute to the impact factor of journals in which the citing items were published. We studied all documents classified by the ISI as "editorial material" in the Science Citation Index between 1999 and 2004 (277,231 records corresponding to editorial material published in 6141 journals). The results show that most journals published only a few documents that included 1 or 2 citations that contributed to the impact factor, although a few journals published many such documents. The data suggest that manipulation of the impact factor by publishing large amounts of editorial material with many citations to the journal itself is not a widely used strategy to increase the impact factor.
