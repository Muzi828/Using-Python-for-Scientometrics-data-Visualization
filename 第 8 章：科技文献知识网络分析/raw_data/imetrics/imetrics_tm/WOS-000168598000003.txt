Brazilian immunology dates from the end of the 19(th) century. The aim of the present paper was to analyze the impact of this field in contemporary Brazilian biomedical research. For this, a 15 years period (1981-1995) was studied. Production of immunological articles in Brazil represented in 1995 a percentage of 8.66 of total papers in biomedical sciences in this country. This level was achieved by an exponential increase in 1991 in the number of papers in immunology followed by a steady increase in the subsequent years. This growth was only observed in articles published in international immunology journals listed by ISI, a similar increase did not occur when the most representative Brazilian journal in biomedical sciences was analyzed. The production in immunology in the last five years (1991-1995) represented 60.69% of total articles in this field published in the whole 15 years period. When quality was assessed based on impact factor of the journals were the articles appeared, 52.71% of total immunology papers had been published in journals with impact factors varying between 7.29 and 3.24. A higher degree of international co-authorship was seen both in articles published in international journals and presentations at international congresses compared to national ones. The main countries collaborating with Brazil were: EUA. England and France. Within Brazil, immunology research was not equally distributed. Around 80% of the articles were produced by four states (Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Bahia). Sao Paulo being responsible for more than half of those articles. This geographic distribution closely resembles the distribution of the Brazilian Society of Immunology (SBI) membership. The main field of study throughout the period was immunoparasitotogy.
