Nanotechnology is an emerging field of science with the potential to generate new and enhance existing products and transform the production process. US patent data is used to track the emergence of nanotechnologies since 1978. The nanotechnologies that have undergone the most development are identified using patent citation data and cocitation patterns of patents are examined to define clusters of related nanotechnologies. The potential for economic impact of the emerging nanotechnologies is assessed using a generality index.
