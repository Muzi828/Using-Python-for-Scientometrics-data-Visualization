In the present paper we proceed from recent results by Gonzalez-Albo and Bordons (2011) obtained from studying the role and impact of proceedings literature in LIS journals. We extend the research to all fields of the sciences and social sciences and address additional research questions concerning publication frequency and citation impact as well as their differences in individual journals and subject fields.
