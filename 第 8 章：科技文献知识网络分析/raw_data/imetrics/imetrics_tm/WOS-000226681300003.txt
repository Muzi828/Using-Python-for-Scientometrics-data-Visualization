The importance of Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI) has significantly increased with the rapid and large-scale migration of local/national security information from physical media to electronic platforms, including the Internet and information systems. Motivated by the significance of ISI in law enforcement (particularly in the digital government context) and the limited investigations of officers' technology-acceptance decision-making, we developed and empirically tested a factor model for explaining law-enforcement officers' technology acceptance. Specifically, our empirical examination targeted the COPLINK technology and involved more than 280 police officers. Overall, our model shows a good fit to the data collected and exhibits satisfactory power for explaining law-enforcement officers' technology acceptance decisions. Our findings have several implications for research and technology management practices in law enforcement, which are also discussed.
