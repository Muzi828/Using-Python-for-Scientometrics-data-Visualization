Research is beginning to accumulate for proximal and virtual team-based work. However, little if any research has examined the effects of the degrees of virtualization on performance, yet purely proximal or virtual teamwork in most professional organizations is becoming rare. This field study examined the effects of virtualization on social influences and social identity factors, and these effects on performance. We found nonlinear relationships between virtualization and cohesion, and virtualization and conflict. Task-relationship orientation and social-technical skills were also found to interact with virtualization on performance. Consequently, recommendations are made regarding hybridization of teams.
