The Novosibirsk region is one of the most industrialized in Siberia. In 1957 the Siberian Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (now Siberian Branch of the RAS (SBRAS)) was set up to stimulate a rapid development of the Siberian and Far East research forces. The goal of this mainly bibliometric, empirical study is to obtain insight into R&D performance in the Novosibirsk region, domestic and international collaborations and the impact of new government science policies focused on boosting the research and innovation activities of regional universities. Key drivers of research performance are institutions of the SBRAS. Second place in terms of research output belongs to Novosibirsk State University. Its research focuses on hard sciences. 75% of its papers were published in collaboration with SBRAS institutions. Research output is growing. Novosibirsk area's share of RFBR grants was stable around 8%. Publications from RFBR grantees in 34 subject categories had a level-aggregated indicator value of one or higher. In these hard-science areas Russian research develops in accordance with global trends. We observed a concentration of domestic collaboration in the Novosibirsk area as well as a strong international collaboration with advanced economies, in particular in the Asia-Pacific region.
