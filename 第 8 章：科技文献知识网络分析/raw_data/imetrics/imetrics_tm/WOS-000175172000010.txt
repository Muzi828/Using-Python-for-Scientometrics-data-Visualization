The noticeable tendency of young Croatian scientists towards a professional and foreign exodus can be explained not so much by their social, professional or material differentiation as by a subjective experience of their own life and professional situation; in other words, dissatisfaction of the researchers with their own professional and social status. The hierarchy of motives of a potential young scientists' drain indicates a complex pattern. It combines suppressive yet attractive motives where economic factors take precedence but with a desire for better conditions in scientific work and opportunities for promotion, thus demonstrating a motivational duality: integration into the general motivational migration pattern while displaying a scientifically motivational specificity.
