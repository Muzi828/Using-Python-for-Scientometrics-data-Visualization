Through this article, we highlight that there are discernibly different patterns among conceptualizations of information, technology, and people across information systems and information science literatures. We do this to clarify the differences in these two areas of scholarship and to further encourage the substantial overlap possible, but not yet engaged, in the research pursued in these areas. We engage this by analyzing published literature in these areas to frame our discussion of the challenges and opportunities for scholars in information science and information systems disciplines to engage in collaborative work.
