In this paper the role of Chinese universities in enterprise-university research collaboration is investigated. This study focuses on a special aspect of the collaboration-co-authored articles. The two cases are analyzed: (1) research collaboration between Baosteel Group Corporation and Chinese universities; (2) research collaboration between China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation and Chinese universities. The co-authorship data over the period 1998-2007 were searched from CNKI database, the largest Chinese publication and citation database. The main findings are as follows: the number of articles co-authored by enterprise and university scientists has been increasing rapidly; the share of co-authored articles has been growing; the authors from universities are more possible to be the first authors; as a whole, enterprise-university co-authored articles tend to receive more citations and get downloaded more frequently; a mathematical orientation emerges in the enterprise-university articles. To reveal and describe such a trend the methods of keywords analysis and co-occurrence analysis are applied. The Chinese government's policy instruments and substantial supports for pushing and improving enterprise-university research collaboration are introduced and analyzed.
