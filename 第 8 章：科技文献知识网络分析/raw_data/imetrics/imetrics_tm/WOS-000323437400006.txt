The gap in statistics between multi-variate and time-series analysis can be bridged by using entropy statistics and recent developments in multi-dimensional scaling. For explaining the evolution of the sciences as non-linear dynamics, the configurations among variables can be important in addition to the statistics of individual variables and trend lines. Animations enable us to combine multiple perspectives (based on configurations of variables) and to visualize path-dependencies in terms of trajectories and regimes. Path-dependent transitions and systems formation can be tested using entropy statistics.
