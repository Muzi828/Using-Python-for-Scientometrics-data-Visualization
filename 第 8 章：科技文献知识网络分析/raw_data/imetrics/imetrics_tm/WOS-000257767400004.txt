The structure of different types of time series in citation analysis is revealed, using an adapted form of the Frandsen-Rousseau notation. Special cases where this approach can be used include time series of impact factors and time series of h-indices, or h-type indices. This leads to a tool describing dynamic aspects of citation analysis. Time series of h-indices are calculated in some specific models. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
