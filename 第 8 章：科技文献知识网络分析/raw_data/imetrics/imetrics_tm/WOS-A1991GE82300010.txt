In the scope of the evaluation of the European program of the R & D on non nuclear energies, we have chosen to study the contracts between the operator of the program, here the Commission of the European Communities, and the teams selected at the issue of a call for tenders. These contracts, recorded on a computerised accounting database, gather information on the 3 important inputs of a program:  The teams involved the themes of the research and the financial level. After corrections, the base gathered 421 research actions, summing up nearly 650 teams for a total cost of 350 MECU. Different statistical treatments have been applied to this base, allowing to characterize the main outlines of the program, its advancement and its dynamic, globally and more acutely on the research's fields that it has supported. The method of analysis 'themes allois" which is proposed applied to a base of contracts slightly transformed thus prefigures a tool for strategic management of technological programs.
