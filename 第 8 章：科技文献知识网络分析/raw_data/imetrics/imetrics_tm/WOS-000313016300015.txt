Drawing from the existing literature on risk and inequality measurement, we implement the notion of "certainty equivalent citation" in order (i) to generalize most of the h-type citation indexes (h-, g-, t-, f-, w-index), and (ii) to highlight the centrality of the decision-maker's preferences on distributive aspects (concentration aversion) for the ranking of citation profiles. In order to highlight the sensitivity of citation orderings with respect to concentration aversion, an application to both simulated and real citation profiles is presented.
