Journals have been ranked on the basis of impact factors for a long time. This is a quality indicator, and often favours review journals with few articles. Integrated impact indicators try to factor in size (quantity) as well, and are correlated with total number of citations. The total number of papers in a portfolio can be considered a zeroth order performance indicator and the total number of citations a first order performance indicator. Indicators like the h-Index and the g-Index are actually performance indicators in that they integrate both quality and quantity assessment into a single number. The p-Index is another variant of this class of performance indicators and is based on the cubic root of a second order performance indicator called the exergy indicator. The Eigenfactor score and article influence are respectively first order quantity and quality indicators. In this paper, we confirm the above relationships.
