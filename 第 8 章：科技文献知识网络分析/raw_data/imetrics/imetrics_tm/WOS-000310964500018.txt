As a novel tool for evaluating research competences of R&D actors, science overlay maps have recently been introduced in the scientometric literature, with associated measures for assessing the degree of diversification in research profiles. In this study, we continue the elaboration of this approach: based on science overlay maps (called here m-maps), a new type of map is introduced to reveal the competence structure of R&D institutions (i-maps). It is argued, that while m-maps represent the multidisciplinarity of research profiles, i-maps convey the extent of interdisciplinarity realized in them. Upon i-maps, a set of new measures are also proposed to quantify this feature. With these measures in hand, and also as a follow-up to our previous work, we apply these measures to a sample of Hungarian Research Institutions (HROs). Based on the obtained rankings, a principal component analysis is conducted to reveal main structural dimensions of researh portfolios (of HROs) covered by these measures. The position of HROs along these dimensions then allows us to draw a typology of organizations, according to various combinations of inter- and multidisciplinarity characteristic of their performance.
