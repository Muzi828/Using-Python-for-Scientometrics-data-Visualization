Most studies of scholarly influence within disciplines using citation data do not investigate the extent of an individual's influence; does it extend over a number of years with a sequence of publications or is it confined to a short period and a small number of publications? Using bibliographic data from a series of quadrennial reports into developments in UK geography, this paper finds that few authors are cited on more than one occasion.
