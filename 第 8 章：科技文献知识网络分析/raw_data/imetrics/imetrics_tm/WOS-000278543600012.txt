The aim of this paper is to characterize the distribution of number of hits and spent time by web session. It also expects to find if there are significant differences between the length and the duration of a session with regard to the point of access-search engine, link or root. Web usage mining was used to analyse 17,174 web sessions that were identified from the webometrics.info web site. Results show that both distribution of length and duration follow an exponential decay. Significant differences between the different origins of the visits were also found, being the search engines' users those who spent most time and did more clicks in their sessions. We conclude that a good SEO policy would be justified, because search engines are the principal intermediaries to this web site. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
