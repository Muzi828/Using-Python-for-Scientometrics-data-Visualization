Citation analysis has become an essential tool for research and academic effectiveness evaluation of universities. However, authorship identity has long been difficult to resolve in bibliometric analyses for many scientific fields, where performance of algorithms against human judgment is far from universal. Now with the boom of authors with compound names (mainly, Latino researchers and from Portuguese language countries) in scientific publications, clustering methods continue lowering their performance, due to completely forgetting the context and order of names (first name"s" and last name"s") of each author in the publication (authorship identity). These kinds of mistakes affect visualization of publications, decreasing the likelihood of finding a given article by a specific author and generating bad quotations in the online systems. This has led to an unsuitable registration and unsuitable grouping of author names "ambiguous authorship identity" of each scientific publication. This process requires more work, time, attention, and accountability on the part of authors, reviewers, journal editors, and providers of bibliographic databases. These errors can be corrected by cross-referencing with each full original article, using manual checks and without ignoring the names issue at the moment of drafting and/or reviewing a manuscript. This paper seeks to raise awareness on how to write author names, highlighting the way in which they are being cited and self-citing the name of authors and co-authors in the publications.
