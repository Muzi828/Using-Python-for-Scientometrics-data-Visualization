Quantitative data or indicators derived from databases are usually treated like any other empirical data. In this article, the social character of the different processes leading to them is outlined. As a social process taking place in systemic organizational structures the genesis of such data cannot be reconstructed as sort of mechanical application of formal rules but only as human (and as such: arbitrary) action. As a consequence the discussion of such data or indicators can no longer be subject to methodology alone but requires support by sociology.
