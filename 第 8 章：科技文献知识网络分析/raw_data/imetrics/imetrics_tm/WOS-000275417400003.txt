Witnessing a substantial growth rate in its scientific production, Iran is considered as one of the recently rising stars in scientific contribution scene. However, its impact in science progress is widely unknown, especially at global level. Studying Iran's scholarly publications and recognition in SCI, the present communication tries to clarify the country's science system performance using regression analyses and then to compare its performance to that of the world, using Relative Citation Rate (RCR) and Relative Subfield Citedness (RW). The results of the regression analyses reveal that although Iran displays considerable weaknesses in its performance, it is increasingly recognized as its outputs grow. According to the RCR values, Iran performed at/above the global level in 21 subfields. However, the RW values show that the country's performance is above the global level in only two subfields. Although Iran is very far from an ideal situation; these evidences can be considered as heralds of a successful movement towards a wealthy scientific future.
