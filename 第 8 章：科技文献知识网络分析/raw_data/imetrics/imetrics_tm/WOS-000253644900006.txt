An empirical law for the rank-order behavior of journal impact factors is found. Using an extensive data base on impact factors including journals on education, agrosciences, geosciences, mathematics, chemistry, medicine, engineering, physics, biosciences and environmental, computer and material sciences, we have found extremely good fittings outperforming other rank-order models. Based in our results, we propose a two-exponent Lotkaian Informetrics. Some extensions to other areas of knowledge are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
