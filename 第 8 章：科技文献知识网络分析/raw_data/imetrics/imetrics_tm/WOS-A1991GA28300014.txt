The European construction has been developping in new areas and at an accelerated pace for the last few years, in the perspective of the single European market of 1993.  One of the important aspects of this evolution has been the establishment of a "European science and technology (S & T) space", through the successive "Framework Programs" of the Commission of the European Community.
The present conference highlighted one result:  we have now measurable hints of the emergence of such a "European S & T space".  The various papers which were presented document indeed the various facets of this new reality of a multinational research system taking shape.
This new reality has been put in evidence through a series of appropriate S & T indicators.  These indicators have been developped by a number of research teams, in general with the financial support of the EC, as a response to an evaluation challenge linked itself to a S & T policy one.  In turn, they led to a challenge on S & T indicators:  this conference showed that the latter could - at least partially - be met.
