The study explores the chronological growth of Indian Biotechnology. Applicability of Lotka's law has been examined for the authorship pattern. Productivity of authors is analyzed and a list of 35 authors publishing more than 10 publications is given. Bradford's law of scattering is used to identify the core journals which cover most of the research and development output of Indian Biotechnology. The study also shows the active authors, institutions and statewise distributions of Indian Biotechnology research output.
