Conferences play a major role for the development of scientific domains. While journal and article contributions in the field of international business (IB) are a general and well researched area of scientometric studies, conferences are not. The absence of a systematic assessment of international business conferences as a reference to the collective status of the Academy of International Business (AIB) community is astonishing. Whatever reasons are accountable for that fact, this paper starts to fill that gap. It establishes a knowledge network composed of the last six years AIB conferences. We collected all the contributions in full text with their abstracts and keywords from 2006 to 2011. All the data have been organized in a data system and we used the information-theoretic clustering method which allows different analytical views through the entire knowledge corpus. The results indicate significant statistical differences between topic modules and keyword threads of the yearly conferences. There are three keywords which dominate as a leitmotif between 2006 and 2011, but the detailed structure changes from conference to conference significantly.
