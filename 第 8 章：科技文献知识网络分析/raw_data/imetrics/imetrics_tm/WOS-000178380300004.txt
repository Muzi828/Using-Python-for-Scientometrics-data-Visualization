We analyse to what extent research collaboration and performance of individual scientists is influenced by the level of consolidation of the team they belong to. A case study of Spanish senior university researchers in Geology is performed. Methodology is based on the combination of a mail survey carried out among a defined set of researchers, and a bibliometric study of their scientific output. Results provide support for the hypothesis that consolidation of research teams would result in a greater facility to establish contacts and collaborations with colleagues, that could benefit all members of the team, fostering their participation in funded projects and favouring their potential to publish in international mainstream journals.
