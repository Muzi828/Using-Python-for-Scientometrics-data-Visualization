The purpose of this paper is to present the preliminary results of a research in progress regarding the subject content analysis of AIDS literature, as produced in or about the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region. An AIDSLINE/OVID literature search was conducted to obtain only the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) -geographic- terms related to the LAC region. The period of study was from 1982 to June, 1998
Indicators regarding the distribution of records throughout the years of study, as well as the subject, check tags, and subject/subheadings distribution patterns were analysed. This was done through rile application of a modular bibliometric information system, as well as the applications of Biblio-Link for Windows, Version 1.2 1994-1997, Research Information Systems; Pro-Cite for Windows, Version 4.0.1 1995-1998, Research Information Systems; and Microsoft EXCEL 97, of 1985-1998, Microsoft Corporation.
A total of 4124 records were obtained and analysed. In descending order, Brazil, Mexico, Haiti, Argentina and Puerto Rico, generated the highest number of citations. Highly ranked MeSH subject headings were Risk Factors; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Sex Behavior; Support, Non US. Govt.; HIV Infections; and Developing Countries.
Results demonstrate that major research concerns centred on the epidemiological aspects and transmission of AIDS; and more recently, on the prevention and control of the disease. A switch of the studies from male to female, and from middle age to adolescence was also observed. The authors provide further lines of research.
