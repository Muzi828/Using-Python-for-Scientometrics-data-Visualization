An "INSERM bibliometric database", which lists the publications of researchers at the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research, was compiled by downloading references from the MEDLINE and the Science Citation Index (SCI) bibliographical databases, and by using micro-computing techniques. MEDLINE and the SCI proved to bc complementary data sources well-suited to this work.
Initial results of an analysis of this INSERM bibliometric database are given. They help to situate the organization's written production in a national and an international context and, in particular, to trace the "profile" of the Institute's researchers and the impact of the journals used in their publications.
