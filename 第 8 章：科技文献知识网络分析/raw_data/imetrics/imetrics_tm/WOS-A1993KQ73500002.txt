A bibliometric survey of 28 scholars named in Poland as being the leading scholars in the fields of Linguistics and of English and American Studies shows that only five of them had done work which was cited more than once a year during the eleven years 1980 to 1990. The reasons are apparently not only the poverty of the libraries currently available in Poland but also the restricted selection of Polish journals represented in the citation indices. Suggestions are made as to how good scholarly work done in Poland could be made better known in the rest of the world.
