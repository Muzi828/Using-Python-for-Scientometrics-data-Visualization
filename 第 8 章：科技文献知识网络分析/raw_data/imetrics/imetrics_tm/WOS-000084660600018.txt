In recent years, several projects were sponsored by NISSAT of the Goverment of India to map Indian Science. As a part of it, a database (COMPENDEX) in engineering field was analysed. It has been found that engineers in India publish their articles mostly in journals; almost all of them publish in English language. They publish in a selected few journals. Only a few of the institutions are concentrated in engineering research. It has been observed that research output in applied physics, light & optics, bioengineering and information science are increasing both at the world and India level. In the area of energy technology metallurgical engineering and food technology, research output is decreasing at both levels.
