The rich body of literature examining communications flow in the research context, an area where Professor Belver Griffith made major contributions, has very direct relevance to the relatively newly emerging recognition in the business community of the importance of knowledge creation and deployment to the competitive performance of an organization. This essay examines and delineates some of those lessons, specifically the tension between open and rich communications versus the need to protect intellectual property; the importance of environmental awareness and serendipity, and achieving the correct balance with efficient use of information searching time; the importance of end-user training; and crafting the balance in knowledge management between codifications and personalization.
