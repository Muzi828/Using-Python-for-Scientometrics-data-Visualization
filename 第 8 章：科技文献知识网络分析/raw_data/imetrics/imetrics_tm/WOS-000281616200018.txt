The citation records of 26 physicists are analyzed in order to determine the modified g index gm which takes multiple coauthorship into account by fractionalized counting of the publications. The results are compared with the original g index as well as with the h index and the respective modified h index h(m). Although the correlations between these indices are relatively strong, the arrangement of the datasets is significantly different in detail depending on whether they are put into order according to the values of either the original or the modified indices.
