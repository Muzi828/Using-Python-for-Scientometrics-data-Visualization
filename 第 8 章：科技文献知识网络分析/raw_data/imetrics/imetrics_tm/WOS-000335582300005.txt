Several researchers have studied serendipitous knowledge discovery in information-seeking behavior. Electronic data in the form of semantic predications have a potential role in literature-based discovery, which can be guided by serendipitous knowledge discovery research findings. We sought to model information-seeking behavior within the context of serendipitous knowledge discovery by leveraging existing research. These efforts were done with an eye for a potential literature-based discovery application that utilizes semantic predications. We performed a literature search, reviewed the results, and applied the findings in developing a model for serendipitous knowledge discovery as an information-seeking behavior. The literature review indicated four important themes in serendipitous knowledge discovery: iteration, change or clarification, a seeker's prior knowledge, and the role of information organization and presentation. The Interaction Flow in Serendipitous Knowledge Discovery (IF-SKD) model includes these themes, and accommodates iterative, evolving search interests. Output can be presented in a manner to enhance short-term memory conceptualization and connections with prior knowledge. Although the IF-SKD model is currently a theoretical structure, its utility is demonstrated through replicating a literature-based discovery event, using a documented search method within the model's steps. The IF-SKD model can potentially serve as the foundation for future literature-based discovery applications.
