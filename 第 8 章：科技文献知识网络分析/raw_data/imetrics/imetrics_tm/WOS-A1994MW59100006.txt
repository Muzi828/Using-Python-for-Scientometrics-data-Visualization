The efficiency of areas of science was evaluated using the DEA method. Areas achieving a maximum orientation or regard of international publication are rated as efficient. The areas of reproductive medicine, organic and inorganic chemistry in the former Federal Republic can thus be regarded as efficient areas of science. No area of scientific research in the former East Germany was able to achieve the optimum. The determinant in this connection is the adverse situation with respect to international orientation whilst no substantial difference in regard for further research could be detected between East and West German research.
