In this article, for any group of authors, we define three different h-indices. First, there is the successive h-index h(2) based on the ranked list of authors and their h-indices h, as defined by Schubert (2007). Next, there is the h-index hp based on the ranked list of authors and their number of publications. Finally, there is the h-index h(c) based on the ranked list of authors and their number of citations. We present formulae for these three indices in Lotkaian informetrics from which it also follows that h(2) < h(p) < h(c). We give a concrete example of a group of 167 authors on the topic "optical flow estimation." Besides these three h-indices, we also calculate the two-by-two Spearman rank correlation coefficient and prove that these rankings are significantly related.
