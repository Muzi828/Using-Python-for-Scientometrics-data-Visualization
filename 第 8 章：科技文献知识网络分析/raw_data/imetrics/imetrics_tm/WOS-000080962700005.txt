Multivariate statistical analysis of the citation profiles of urology and related journals (i.e. the relative extent to which each journal cites itself and other journals within a set) has highlighted hidden correlations. We reveal the existence of a 'transatlantic' rift in citation practice and of a confined discipline-oriented world which interfaces weakly with many other disciplines. We also interpret the results of our analyses in terms of basic and clinical research and examine whether there is a time-related selectivity in citation. Taken together, our results call for a serious appraisal of present-day research trends and of their evaluation. The open question is how to create a terrain that will foster original, possibly interdisciplinary, research in developed nations whilst maintaining cultural individuality.
