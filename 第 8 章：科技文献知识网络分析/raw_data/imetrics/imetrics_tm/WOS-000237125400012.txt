Using content analysis, this study explored the role of the literature in the diffusion of new information; the influence of the literature on the innovation-decision process; and how the concept of tie strength can contribute to a greater understanding of the role of the literature in information transmission. Diffusion of innovations and strength of weak ties theories provided the framework that informed this research, and an illustrated medical case study, changing practices related to hormone therapy for menopausal women, provided context for the study. Findings suggest that published literature impacts the innovation-decision process and thus plays an integral role in the diffusion of medical innovation to physicians and consumers; that the view of literature as a bridging "weak tie" in a multifactor communication network allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the role of published literature in information diffusion; and that medical and lay articles are not neutral channels, they function to provide information, reinforce knowledge, and produce and shape meaning.
