Collaborative research in Spain in the field of pharmacology is studied. Co-authored papers in periodicals were one of the indicators used to quantify collaborative research results. Through Spanish publications of pharmacologists, collaborations between different institutions in the same city are mostly detected. Through foreign papers quite different networks were found, both amongst Spanish cities and with institutions in other countries. In case of Spanish pharmaceutical industry questionnaires were used to determine their links with other institutions, mostly through research projects.
