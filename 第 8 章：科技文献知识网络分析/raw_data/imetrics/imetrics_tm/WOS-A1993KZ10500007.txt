In order to characterize the integration of countries into the world intellectual property network some indicators are offered. Percentage Patent Representation (PPR) gives the percentage share of patents granted to the inventors of a given country in the total number of patents granted to all foreign patentees.  The ratio of PPR indices for two countries yields the Bilateral Patent Balance (BPB) indicator, which is characteristic of a mutual patent representation. Patent Dominancy (PD) index is the number of BPB indices higher than unity for a set of countries. PD indices can be related to GDP and growth of export values.
