We have studied the citation rates and characteristics of 572 Turkish physics publications that appeared in the source journals listed in the Science Citation Index (SCI) for the period 1982-1990 to drive the following results: The papers appeared in a set of 94 journals, and 68% of the total output went to 21 of these; half of which are journals of high impact. On the average, papers from Turkey that appeared in the American and European journals are cited at rates higher than the corresponding ''average'' papers. There has been a substantial shift of Turkish papers from European journals to American journals over the last few years. These changes are an example of the process by which science in a less developed country becomes integrated into the word scientific community.
