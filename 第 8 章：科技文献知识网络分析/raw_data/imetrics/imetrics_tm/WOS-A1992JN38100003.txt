Direct, indirect, and implicit citation to an eponymous paper is examined to determine the time span over which eponymy develops.  The eponym of a very highly cited method paper was commonly used, indexed, and became a chapter title within 5 years after publication. It began to receive implicit citations within about 6 years, and within 14 years, the implicit citation rate exceeded 50%. Definitions of three forms of citation are given, and an empirical definition of eponymy is offered.
