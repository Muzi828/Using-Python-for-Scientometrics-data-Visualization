We first introduced interesting definitions of "heartbeat" and "heartbeat spectrum" for "sleeping beauties", based on van Raan's variables. Then, we investigated 58,963 papers of Nobel laureates during 1900-2000 and found 758 sleeping beauties. By proposing and using G(s) index, an adjustment of Gini coefficient, to measure the inequality of "heartbeat spectrum", we observed that publications which possess "late heartbeats" (most citations were received in the second half of sleeping period) have higher awakening probability than those have "early heartbeats" (most citations were received in the first half of sleeping period). The awakening probability appears the highest if an article's G(s) index exists in the interval [0.2, 0.6). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
