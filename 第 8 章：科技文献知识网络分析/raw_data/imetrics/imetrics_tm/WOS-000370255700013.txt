In this article I investigate the shortcomings of exact string match-based author self-citation detection methods. The contributions of this study are twofold. First, I apply a fuzzy string matching algorithm for self-citation detection and benchmark this approach and other common methods of exclusively author name-based self-citation detection against a manually curated ground truth sample. Near full recall can be achieved with the proposed method while incurring only negligible precision loss. Second, I report some important observations from the results about the extent of latent self-citations and their characteristics and give an example of the effect of improved self-citation detection on the document level self-citation rate of real data.
