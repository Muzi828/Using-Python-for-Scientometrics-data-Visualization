While most of us who study intellectual and technical advancement believe that innovations tend to swarm, the details of this process are not well understood. The aggregate-level behavior of US patents is examined as a way to better infer the process that generates innovation. The amount of swarming decreases as the observational period increases, which indicates that the process of innovation is not perfectly self-similar. Instead, the effects of innovations are mostly contained within specialized areas, and do not often trigger further advances in other fields.
