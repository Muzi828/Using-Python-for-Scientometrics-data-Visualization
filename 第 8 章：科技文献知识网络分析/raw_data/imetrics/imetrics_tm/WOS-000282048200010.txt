A bibliometric analysis of Spanish cardiovascular research is presented. The study focuses on the productivity, visibility and citation impact in an international, notably European context. Special attention is given to international collaboration. The underlying bibliographic data are collected from Thomson Reuters's Web of Science on the basis of a 'hybrid' search strategy combining core journals, lexical terms and citation links especially developed for the field of cardiology.
