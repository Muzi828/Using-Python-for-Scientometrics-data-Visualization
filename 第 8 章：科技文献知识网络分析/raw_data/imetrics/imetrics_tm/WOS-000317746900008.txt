The purpose was to undertake a descriptive, quantitative comparative analysis of the production, visibility and online access to public health research results in the field of health public policy among Mexico, Chile and Argentina. A literature search in the field was conducted in MEDLINE (1966-2010) and LILACS (1980-2010) through BIREME's virtual health library. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to identify the type of documents produced, authorship, language of publication, check-tags, major subject content, journals used, and main participating institutions. Visibility was obtained through the identification of the document type used and the subject content, per database. Accessibility was limited to online full-text access. Only 6 (out of 30) health science descriptors under health public policy have emerged as relevant by all three countries in both databases; namely, health services accessibility; health care reform; decentralization; health systems; consumer participation and financing, health. References retrieved from MEDLINE corresponded to journal articles in all three countries. In LILACS monographs corresponded to over 40 %. Overall health public policy documents addressed adult female and male studies, with the exception of Argentina which addressed female and male children. Full-text accessibility was less than 25 % of total production. Health public policy research is in its infancy in Spanish speaking Latin America. While health care reforms have been implemented regionally in the last three decades, few (20 %) subject contents have been explored. Further research is needed to fill existing gaps; as well as bigger efforts to increase online full-text accessibility and dissemination of research results.
