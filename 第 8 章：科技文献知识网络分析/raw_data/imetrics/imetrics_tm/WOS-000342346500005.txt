Organizing and structuring online information becomes a mainstream activity within large organizations as increasing volumes of information are made available via the web. General methodologies, best practice, and guidelines for web information architecture (IA) have been developed and refined. This research paper extends the knowledge base for web IA by examining situated practice within large organizations and building theory to provide a deeper understanding of how large organizations construct information-rich websites. A grounded theory, The Situated Practice of Web IA in Large Organizations, is proposed as an integrated theoretical framework for practice in this context. The theoretical framework is composed of 4 foundational constructs titled: owning, negotiating, enacting, and knowing web IA. Building on these foundations, an integrating central construct of practicing web IA is proposed. This theoretical framework will inform large organizations and practitioners as they approach web IA.
