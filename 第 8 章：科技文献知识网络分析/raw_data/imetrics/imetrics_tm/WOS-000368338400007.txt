Although news websites are used by a large and increasing number of people, there is a lack of research within human-computer interaction regarding users' experience with this type of interactive technology. In the current research, existing measures of user-experience factors were identified and, using an online survey, answers to psychometric scales to measure website characteristics, need fulfillment, affective reactions, and constructs of technology acceptance and user experience were collected from regular users of news sites. A comprehensive user-experience model was formulated to explain acceptance and quality judgments of news sites. The main contribution of the current study is the application of influential models of user experience and technology acceptance to the domain of online news. By integrating both types of variable in a comprehensive model, the relationships between the types of variable are clarified both theoretically and empirically. Implications of the model for theory, further research, and system design are discussed.
