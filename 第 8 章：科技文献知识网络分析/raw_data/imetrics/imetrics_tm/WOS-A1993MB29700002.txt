This article looks at authorship patterns in CJNR from 1970 to 1991. A tally was taken of the number of single, double and multiple authorships for each year which, in turn, were combined into one seven year and three five year intervals. Frequency counts were converted into percentages, chi-squares were computed, and author/article ratios were calculated for each year. Results revealed a decrease in the number of single authored articles and an increase in the number of co- and multiple authored articles from 1982 on. The author/article ratios fluctuated somewhat, but, overall showed marked increases. It was tentatively concluded that nursing is not unlike other disciplines, that it too is experiencing changes in authorship patterns. Reasons for the changes are tendered along with suggestions for further research.
