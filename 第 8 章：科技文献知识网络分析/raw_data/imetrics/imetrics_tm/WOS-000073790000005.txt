In this study we continue the application of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the R&D effort of European countries. We use GDP, active population and R&D expenditure as inputs, and publications and patents as outputs. Being effective means that, in order to obtain a maximum efficiency score countries are forced to perform on every output goal. A discussion of each country's performance and a comparison with May's Science results concludes our analysis.
