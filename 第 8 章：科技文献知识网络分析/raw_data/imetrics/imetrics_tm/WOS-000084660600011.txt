Collaboration in science has become a prevailing trend and it will be worthwhile to study the patterns of co-authorships in scientific research. In this study a three-dimensional behavioural pattern of Indian medicinal co-authorship network is presented. The high evenness of this pattern has caused us to carry out a non-linear regression analysis. The pattern of Indian medicinal co-authorships can be described by the same non-linear mathematical function that describes the behavioural patterns of international medicine co-authorship networks and networks of other scientific disciplines. The following question has arise: Is there a general validity of this function in co-authorship networks?
