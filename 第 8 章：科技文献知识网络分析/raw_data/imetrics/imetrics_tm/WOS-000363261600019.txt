Tropical trees of Calophyllum genus (Calophyllaceae) have chemical and biological importance as potential source of secondary active metabolites which can lead to the development of new drugs. Research on this species has been rising since 1992 due to the discovering of anti-HIV properties of Calanolide A found in Calophyllum inophyllum leaves. This compound is the most important natural product for potential development of new anti-HIV drugs and phytomedicines. The scientometric analysis (1953-2014) here performed revealed that the most studied species of Calophyllum genus are: C. inophyllum and C. brasiliense, distributed in the Asian, and American continents, respectively. Current research on these species is carried out mainly in India and Brazil, respectively, where these species grow. Research on C. brasiliense is focused mainly on ecological, antiparasitic, cytotoxic properties, and isolation of new compounds. Chemical studies and biodiesel development are the main topics in the case of C. inophyllum. Text mining analysis revealed that coumarins, and xanthones are the main secondary active metabolites responsible for most of the reported pharmacological properties, and are potential compounds for the treatment of leukemia and against intracellular parasites causing American Trypanosomiasis and Leshmaniasis. On the other hand, C. inophyllum represents an important source for the development of 2nd generation biodiesel. Medicinal and industrial applications of these species may impulse sustainable forest plantations. To our knowledge this is the first scientometric and text mining analysis of chemical and biomedical research on Calophyllum genus, C. brasiliense and C. inophyllum.
