Topicality, while demonstrably an empirically manageable variable of investigation, engenders aspects of cognitive complexity that may, or may not, be easily managed during user interactions with IR systems. If an item retrieved from an IR system is considered to be on topic by a user, the meaning of that judgment may imply other underlying criteria. What makes an item on topic for users is the subject of this investigation. Although topicality has served to generate a great deal of attention in the body of information science literature, the meaning of topicality to IR system users has suffered from a lack of full understanding in designing more effective approaches to information search and retrieval. This investigation takes an inductive approach to the deductive extraction of characteristics that describe and explain how items retrieved from interactions with IR systems can be considered as on topic.
