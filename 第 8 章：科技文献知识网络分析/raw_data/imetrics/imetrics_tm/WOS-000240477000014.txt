In this short paper I propose a combination of qualitative and quantitative criteria to classify the quality, talent and creative thinking of the scientists of the "hard", medical and biological sciences. The rationale for the proposed classification is to focus on the impact and overall achievements of each individual scientist and on how he is perceived by his own community. This new method is probably more complete than any other form of traditional judgment of a scientist's achievements and reputation, and may be useful for funding agencies, editors of scientific journals, science academies, universities, and research laboratories.
