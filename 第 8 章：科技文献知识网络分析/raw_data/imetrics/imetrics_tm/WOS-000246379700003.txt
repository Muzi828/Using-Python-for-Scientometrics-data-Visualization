The field of Information Science is constantly changing. Therefore, information scientists are required to regularly review-and if necessary-redefine its fundamental building blocks. This article is one of a group of four articles, which resulted from a Critical Delphi study conducted in 2003-2005 (Zins, 2007a, 2007b, 2007c). The study, "Knowledge Map of Information Science," was aimed at exploring the foundations of information science. The international panel was composed of 57 leading scholars from 16 countries who represent nearly all the major subfields and important aspects of the field. This particular article documents 28 classification schemes of Information Science that were compiled by leading scholars in the academic community. This unique collection of 28 classification schemes portrays and documents the profile of contemporary Information Science at the beginning of the 21st century.
