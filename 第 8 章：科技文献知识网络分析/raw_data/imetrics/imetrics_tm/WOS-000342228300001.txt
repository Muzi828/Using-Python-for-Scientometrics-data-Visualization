Transformations and applications of scientific knowledge into new technologies are usually complex interactive processes. Is it possible to detect, from bibliographic information alone, structural alterations and significant events within these processes that may indicate breakthrough discoveries? In this empirical study we focus on R&D processes leading to HIV/AIDS medicines called Integrase Inhibitors. Where scientific progress and discoveries are reflected in research papers, patents signify inventions and technological achievements. Our temporal analysis of distinctive events in this R&D area, tracing trends within both bibliographic information sources, is driven by three bibliometric indicators: (1) contributions of 'bridging researchers' who are also inventors, (2) 'key papers' that subject experts in the field considered milestones in the research process, and (3) the multidisciplinary impact of those papers. The main results indicate that a combination of key papers, bridging researchers and multidisciplinary impact might help track potential 'Charge type' breakthrough developments.
