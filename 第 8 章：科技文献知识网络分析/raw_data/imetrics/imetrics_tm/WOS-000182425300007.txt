This paper presents a novel user interface that provides global visualizations of large document sets in order to help users to formulate the query that corresponds to their information needs and to access the corresponding documents. An important element of the approach we introduce is the use of concept hierarchies (CHs) in order to structure the document collection. Each CH corresponds to a facet of the documents users can be interested in. Users browse these CHs in order to specify and refine their information needs. Additionally the interface is based on OLAP principles and multi-dimensional analysis operators are provided to users in order to allow them to explore a document collection.
