First order digits in data sets of natural and social data often follow a distribution called Benford's law. We studied the number of articles published, citations received and impact factors of all journals indexed in the Science Citation Index from 1998 to 2007. We tested their compliance with Benford's law. Citations data followed Benford's law remarkably well in all years studied. However, for the data on the numbers of articles, the differences between the values predicted by Benford's law and the observed values were always statistically significant. This was also the case for most data for impact factors.
