This article presents results of a study on the applicability of journal mapping of knowledge domains beyond the databases produced by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). The utility and validity of this generalisation is discussed with an emphasis on its added value in comparison to 'traditional' ISI-based journal maps, i.e. those restricted to (predominantly English-language) ISI-covered journals, and journal-to-journal citation data retrieved from ISI's Journal Citation Reports. The mapping methodology a as applied to Manufacturing technology and management - a multidisciplinary domain situated on the interface of science and technology. The International Journal of Production Economics was singled out as a special case for the validation study of the maps. Results of this study, involving several subject experts, indicate that a journal content-based map was not only far superior to the journal citation map, but also outperformed the map derived from the combination of both types of data. The selection of periodicals from other databases such as COMPENDEX produced a substantial number of additional titles of which only half were also covered by ISI.
