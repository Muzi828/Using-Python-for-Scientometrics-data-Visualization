The advanced materials studied were those composites based on ceramic, boron, carbon and aramid fibres. Research level was quantified by a bibliometric analysis of publications, including a study of citations, an analysis of patents, a professional assessment of Soviet work by reviewing the open literature and by discussing with scientists and engineers in the former Soviet Union. The conclusion drawn was that the level of research in the former USSR did not match that in the West. There were, however, several niche areas were the level of research was comparable or in advance of the West, notably aramid fibres.
