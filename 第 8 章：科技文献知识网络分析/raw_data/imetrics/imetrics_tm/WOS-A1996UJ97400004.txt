An international electronic thesis system is proposed to provide ready access to doctoral dissertations and ensure uniform standards. To establish common criteria, the publication-based Dutch doctoral degree system was assessed and compared with studies of other national systems. Current Dutch doctoral theses in biomedical fields were of a high standard. 93% of theses were based on published work. The median number of papers per thesis was four, with five authors per paper. The candidate was the key author on 84%. Representative journals of publication ranked in the top quartile of the Science Citation Index with a median rank of 241.
