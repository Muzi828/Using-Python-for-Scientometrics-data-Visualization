In the paper we will present the adjustments we implemented on the mapping procedure. We consider them as important improvements to make the maps more user-friendly. The improvements concern the implementation of graphical user interfaces, and the addition of 'map-external' information. This interface enables the users of the maps to focus onto their specific areas of interest and to determine the position of actors in the field. In addition the 'map-external' information contributes to an objective validation of the maps. The presentation will include a demonstration of the electronic maps and added tools.
