Using a dataset of refereed conference papers, this work explores the determinants of academic production in the field of management. The estimation of a count data model shows that the countries' level of economic development and their economy size have a positive and highly significant effect on scholarly management knowledge production. The linguistic variable (English as official language), which has been cited by the literature as an important factor facilitating the participation in the international scientific arena, has also a positive and statistically significant effect.
