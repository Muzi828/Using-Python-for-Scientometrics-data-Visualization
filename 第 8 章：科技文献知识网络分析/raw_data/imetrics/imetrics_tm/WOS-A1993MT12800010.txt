This study is the first to provide estimates of the economies of scale in science and technology agencies. As such, it sheds new light on issues of interest to policy-makers. The study identifies that there are strong economies of scale to be captured in organisations with budgets less than $200 million. The least efficient agency in the study requires 136 times more input per unit of output than the most efficient one. The study was unable to identify diseconomies of scale up to the range of $3 billion. The policy implications for countries which are small in science in particular, are discussed.
