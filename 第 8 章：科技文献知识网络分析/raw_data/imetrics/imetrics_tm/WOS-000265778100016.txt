Although many studies have analyzed the "synchronic" correlation of properties between authors and their co-authors, the "diachronic" correlation of properties, i.e., the correlation between their subsequent and precedent activity, has not yet been sufficiently studied using quantitative methods. This study pays attention not only to productivity but also the importance in the collaboration network as a measure of the researcher's activity, and clarifies whether there is any connection between (i) the researcher's activity subsequent to a collaboration and (ii) the collaborator's precedent activity, aiming at deriving knowledge about the diachronic effect of collaborators.
