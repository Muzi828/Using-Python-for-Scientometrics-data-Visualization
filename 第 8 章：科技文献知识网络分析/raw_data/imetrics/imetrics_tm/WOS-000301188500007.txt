The editorial handling of articles in scientific journals as a human activity process is considered. Using recently proposed approaches of human dynamics theory we examine the probability distributions of random variables reflecting the temporal characteristics of studied processes. The first part of this article contains our results of analysis of the real data about articles published in scientific journals. The second part is devoted to modeling of time-series connected with editorial work. The purpose of our study is to present new object that can be studied in terms of human dynamics theory and to corroborate the scientometrical application of the results obtained.
