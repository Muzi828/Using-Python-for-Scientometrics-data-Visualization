Starting in 1986, a small team at ISNAR has been working to establish a global database on national agricultural research systems.  This paper provides an overview of the conceptual and practical difficulties of measuring the capacity of national agricultural research systems.  Special attention is given to alternative procedures to translate research expenditures expressed in current local currency units into a constant common numeraire.  The paper closes with a preliminary assessment of the development of national agricultural research systems over the period 1961-65 to 1981-85.
