The calculation of Hirsch's h-index is a detail-ignoring way, therefore, single h-index could not reflect the difference of time spans for scientists to accumulate their papers and citations. In this study the h-index sequence and the h-index matrix are constructed, which complement the absent details of single h-index, reveal different increasing manner and the increasing mechanism of the h-index, and make the scientists at different scientific age comparable.
