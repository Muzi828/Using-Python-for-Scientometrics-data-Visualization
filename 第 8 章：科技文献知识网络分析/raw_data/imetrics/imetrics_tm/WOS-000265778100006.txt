This article reports for first time the state of science and technology in the African Continent on the basis of two scientometric indicators - number of research publications and number of patents awarded. Our analysis shows that Africa produced 68,945 publications over the 2000-2004 period or 1.8% of the World's publications. In comparison India produced 2.4% and Latin America 3.5% of the World's research. More detailed analysis reveals that research in Africa is concentrated in just two countries - South Africa and Egypt. These two counties produce just above 50% of the Continent's publications and the top eight countries produce above 80% of the Continent's research. Disciplinary analysis reveals that few African countries have the minimum number of scientists required for the functioning of a scientific discipline. Examination of the Continent's inventive profile, as manifested in patents, indicates that Africa produces less than one thousand of the world's inventions. Furthermore 88% of the Continent's inventive activity is concentrated in South Africa. The article recommends that the African Governments should pay particular attention in developing their national research systems.
