The aim of the study is to explore the effects of the increase in the number of publications or citations on several impact indicators by a single journal paper or citation. The possible change of the h-index, A-index, R-index, pi-index, pi-rate, Journal Paper Citedness ( JPC), and Citation Distribution Score (CDS) is followed by models. Particular attention is given to the increase of the indices by a single plus citation. The results obtained by the " successively built-up indicator" model show that with increasing number of citations or self-citations the indices may increase substantially. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
