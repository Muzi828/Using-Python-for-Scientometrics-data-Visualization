In a recently published article, HARGENS & FIERTING (2006) apply the row-column (RC) association model to peer review to analyze the association between two referees' recommendations and an editor's decision at two scholarly journals. In the present study we analyze 1,954 applications to the Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds (B.I.F.) for doctoral and post-doctoral fellowships, which the B.I.F. evaluates in three stages (first stage: evaluation by an external reviewer; second stage: evaluation by an internal reviewer (staff member); third stage: final decision by the B.I.F. Board of Trustees). Using the RC association model, we show - in accordance with the results of HARGENS & HERTING (2006) - that a single latent dimension is sufficient to account for the association between (internal and external) reviewers' recommendations and the fellowship award decision by the Board. This result indicates that the latent dimension underlying reviewers' recommendations and the Board's decisions reflects the merit of an application being evaluated. While the statistical analyses establish that overall, favorable evaluations by the reviewers correspond with favorable decisions by the Board (and vice versa), the ordering of the scale values yielded by the estimation of the RC association model also shows that internal reviewers' recommendations have a greater influence on the Board's decisions than recommendations by external reviewers.
