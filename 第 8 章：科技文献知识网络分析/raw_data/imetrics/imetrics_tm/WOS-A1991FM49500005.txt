We use a co-word analysis of the key words of 6055 articles that appeared in the psychology of work from 1973 to 1987 and were listed in the PASCAL database to bring out changes in the scientific themes of the field.  We can discern which themes remained significant and which disappeared, as well as the psychology of work's borrowings from and contributions to other disciplines.  Co-word analysis therefore constitutes a new tool in the science policy arena.
