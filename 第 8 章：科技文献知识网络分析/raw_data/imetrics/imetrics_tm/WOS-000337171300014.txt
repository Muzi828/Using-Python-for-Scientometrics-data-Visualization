Understanding the direction and magnitude of soil science publication in the Philippines is crucial in formulating research priorities and funding allocation. There is no consensus on the current state of soil science publication in the Philippines, thus this study was conducted to elucidate the trend in the soil science publication. We conducted an in-depth analysis on the total number of publications and the total number of citations of soil science publications collected from Thomson ISI database. Results revealed an upsurge in soil science publication from 1970 to 2000 with no indication that this trend is slowing down. Increases in the number of citations with time are consistent with increases in the total number of publications (r = 0.93; p < 0.05). Results further revealed that the soil science publication in the Philippines is biased towards rice research particularly soil water with very few studies were published for plant nutrition and soil chemistry. The present study highlights the need for a paradigm shift in soil science research from mostly rice related research to environmental research. Ways to increase soil science publication among Filipino soil scientist's particularly in academic institutions is proposed. Finally, since only a few government-funded research have been published, future studies should stress on identifying factors that influence scientific productivity of most soil scientists in the Philippines.
