Over the past 20 years, researchers contributed substantially, empirically, to the study of the determinants of academic research publication. All of these studies used a single equation to model the relationship between research publication (output) and research collaboration (input). In this modeling research publication was assumed as an endogenous variable and research collaboration was assumed as an exogenous. This study was the first ever study that provided an evidence of two way relationship between the input and output, and thus contributed theoretically and empirically to the existing body of literature. This study found that research collaboration contributed to the advancement of research publication and vice versa. Therefore, the previous studies that used a unidirectional relationship estimated biased estimates of the determinants of research publications.
