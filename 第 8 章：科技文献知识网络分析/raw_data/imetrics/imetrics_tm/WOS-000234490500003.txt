With the increasing globalization of the world economy, there has been a growing interest in the potential contributions of good governance to accelerating the rate of economic and social development in the developing countries, and enhance their smooth integration into the emerging global economy. Simultaneously, developed economies are experiencing an increasing proportion in the contribution of knowledge, information, and telecommunication sectors to their overall gross domestic product. This is placing increased focus on the role and contribution of national information infrastructure to economic productivity, and in extension, to the economic and social development of nations. In this article, the authors explore the link between information and communication technologies (ICTs), governance, and social economic development in the developing countries. They empirically conclude that contributions of ICTs to social-economic development are influenced by sociopolitical governance-leading to national development through more prudent and egalitarian application and use of the ICTs' portfolio. The contingent role of governance on ICTs and national development paves the path towards recognizing the importance of sociopolitical moderators.
