As health information seekers pursue their "right to know" when investigating medical options, the question of reliable health information resources becomes paramount. Previous research has not addressed widely the connection between women as the health information seeker and quality health information, nor has women's awareness of specific health and medical resources been adequately evaluated. A study with a convenience sample of 119 women assessed the process of seeking health information (women's health information needs, the search strategies they employed for filling the information need, and the use of the health information found), and their awareness of specific health and medical information resources. Our survey instrument was based on Kuhlthau's Information Search Process (ISP) model. Results appeared to address the uncertainty stage of the ISP model, as there were conflicting responses regarding the facility of locating information, the usefulness of the information found, and whether or not the subjects' health questions were answered. The study also identified a low awareness by our respondents of specific health and medical information resources. There is an opportunity for health information providers to play a role in mediating at this uncertainty stage to connect health information seekers with reliable information.
