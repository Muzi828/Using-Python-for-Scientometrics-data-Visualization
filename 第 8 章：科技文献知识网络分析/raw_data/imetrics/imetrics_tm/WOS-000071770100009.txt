In his book on "Documentation", Bradford derived the law of scattering, based on algebric explanation with the supposition that n(1) = n(2) = n. n(1) and n(2) are computed based on average no. of articles per journals in the first three zones. An analysis of a small sample of 12 data sets, using t-test suggests that it is unlikely that n(1) = n(2). Further an attempt has been made to identify a suitable model to explain the law of scattering; among the various models tried, log-normal fits much better than many models including the log-linear model.
