The h-index has been shown to increase in many cases mostly because of citations to rather old publications. This inertia can be circumvented by restricting the evaluation to a publication and citation time window. Here I report results of an empirical study analyzing the evolution of the thus defined timed h-index in dependence on the length of the time window. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
