Many academic journals of China began to be published in English when China opened door to the world more than 20 years ago. Tsinghua University started to publish an academic journal, the Tsinghua Science and Technology since 1996. We made statistical analyses on the regional distribution on the authors and of the references cited by the articles of Tsinghua Science and Technology from 1996 to 2002. The results show that although the authors are mainly from the Tsinghua University, the number of authors from other regions, especially the number of oversea authors, are increasing in recent years; the average number of articles cited by every article is increasing from 6.9 in 1996 to 13.4 in 2002. The results suggest that we must learn the successful experiences from well-known journals. Attracting high-level articles and realizing the internationalization of the journal will help us to develop the journal.
