This study attempts to analyse the usability of international databases such as the Science Citation Index (SCI) for the observation of the international collaboration in lesser-developed countries. We have examined the adequacy of this data source (the SCI) in perceiving the international scientific activities of nine Latin American countries. We have studied the relationships of these countries with their main foreign partners in the large fields of science. It has been observed that some of these relationships are not covered by the data source under study.  The creation of an information system storing complementary data suited for the identification of existing international collaborative projects is recommended. In the long-range future such a system would provide more appropriate information for the analyses of international collaboration.
