This study uncovers the evolution of a fuel cell research network through a bibliometric study focusing on a period from 1991 to 2010. From a dataset of 37,435 research articles, the study focuses on the evolution of fuel cell research networks at a national level. Focusing solely on the expansion of the research networks, and the policies effecting collaboration, the paper poses three research questions (1) Is research into fuel cells more unconcentrated than in science overall and if so, (2) is there changes within time and (3) can we identify a cluster among certain countries. To answer the research questions, the data was compared to findings on the overall scientific output worldwide. In addition, an ego network analysis was performed and a modularity algorithm was used in order to identify clusters from the network data. The study showed that fuel cell research co-operation has had a distinct evolution within the time frame of the study. Research has increased in both volume and in co-operation, but research co-operation is more unconcentrated than in science overall. Non-TRIAD countries have a stronger role in fuel cell research than in science overall. Clusters in research co-operation have evolved into two modes of co-operation-one around Asia and North America and the second around European co-operation with US and Asia.
