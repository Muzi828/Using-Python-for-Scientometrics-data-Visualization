This work presents a new stemming algorithm. This algorithm stores the stemming information in tree structures. This storage allows us to enhance the performance of the algorithm due to the reduction of the search space and the overall complexity. The final result of that stemming algorithm is a normalized concept, understanding this process as the automatic extraction of the generic form (or a lexeme) for a selected term.
