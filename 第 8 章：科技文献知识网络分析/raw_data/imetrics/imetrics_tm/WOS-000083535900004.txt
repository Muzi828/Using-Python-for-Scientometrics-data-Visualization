The scientific publications of 231 chemistry professors employed at Turkish Universities are studied for a period of 10 years. The quantitative as well as the qualitative aspects of the trends in the scientific information output of this group are analyzed in order to evaluate the underlying facts of the recent increase in the number of publications coming from Turkey. The selected group is a fairly good representative of the Turkish scientific community and our observations could be generalized to describe the development of basic sciences in Turkey. We conclude that even though there exists a serious increase in the scientific output from Turkey, a rather small portion of the studied group is responsible both for high number of publications and for higher quality.
