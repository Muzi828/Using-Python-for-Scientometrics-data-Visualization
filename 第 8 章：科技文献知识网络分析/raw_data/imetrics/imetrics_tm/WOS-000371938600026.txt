In this study we present an application which can be accessed via www.excellence-networks.net and which represents networks of scientific institutions worldwide. The application is based on papers (articles, reviews and conference papers) published between 2007 and 2011. It uses (network) data, on which the SCImago Institutions Ranking is based (Scopus data from Elsevier). Using this data, institutional networks have been estimated with statistical models (Bayesian multilevel logistic regression, BMLR) for a number of Scopus subject areas. Within single subject areas, we have investigated and visualized how successfully overall an institution (reference institution) has collaborated (compared to all the other institutions in a subject area), and with which other institutions (network institutions) a reference institution has collaborated particularly successfully. The "best paper rate" (statistically estimated) was used as an indicator for evaluating the collaboration success of an institution. This gives the proportion of highly cited papers from an institution, and is considered generally as an indicator for measuring impact in bibliometrics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
