An attempt is made to find statistical evidences of the I elation between international coauthorship and citation impact. It was found that international co-authorship. in average, results in publications with higher citation rates than purely domestic papers. No correlation has been found, however, between the strength of co-authorship links and the relative citation eminence of the resulting publications. International co-authorship links in chemistry, as represented by the well-known Salton's measure, displayed a characteristic pattern reflecting geopolitical, historical, linguistic, etc. relations among countries. A new indicator, representing also the asymmetry of co-authorship links was used to reveal main "attractive" and "repulsive" centres of co-operation.
