With the primary goal of exploring whether citation analysis using scientific papers found on the Web as a data source is a worthwhile means of studying scholarly communication in the new digital environment, the present case study examines the scholarly communication patterns in XML research revealed by citation analysis of ResearchIndex data and SCI data. Results suggest that citation analysis using scientific papers found on the Web as a data source has both advantages and disadvantages when compared with citation analysis of SCI data, but is nonetheless a valid method for evaluating scholarly contributions and for studying the intellectual structure in XML research.
