Using an application of scientometric methodology to the analysis of scientific communication, relationships between number of submissions of scientific articles and calendar events (e.g., festive seasons, weekend vacations, national public holidays, Chinese New Year, Christmas) are examined quantitatively. With regard to the aim of understanding the complexities of these relationships, the time series include weekly, monthly, and seasonal variations on the basis of Received Date as reported on the Article History of the Elsevier paper format. Data records are collected during twenty-year ( 1990-2010) and one-year periods - as case study - ended 31 December 2008. The analysis shows that the overall submission rates are strongly influenced by calendar events. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
