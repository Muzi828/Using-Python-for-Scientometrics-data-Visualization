The distribution of articles involving artificial neural networks (ANN) in the fields of medicine and biology and appearing in the ISI (Institute for Scientific Information) databases during the period 2000-2001 was analysed. The following parameters were considered: the number of articles, the total impact factor, the ISI journal category, the source country population, and the gross domestic product. Among the 803 articles and the 49 countries considered, the 5 most prolific (in term of the number of publications) were the USA, The United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and Canada; other active countries included Sweden, Netherlands, Spain, France, Japan, and China. Comparison between the USA and the European Union, and the distribution of ANN publications among the subdisciplines of the life sciences and clinical medicine are also presented.
