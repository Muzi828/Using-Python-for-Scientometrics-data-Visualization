Recently, a normalized version of the g-index has been proposed as an impact and concentration measure: the so-called s measure. The main problem with this measure is that-somewhat paradoxically-it may be that s = 1 even in the case in which citations are perfectly evenly spread across articles. We prove that the measure s can and should be improved by a different choice of a normalizing term. This is done by defining the latter as a function of the citation count of the single most cited paper. The new index presented here does not suffer from insensitivity to citation transfers within the g-core.
