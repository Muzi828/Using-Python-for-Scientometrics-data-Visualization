An analysis of 9,957 papers published by Indian scientists and indexed by WoS in 12 sub-disciplines of life sciences during 2008-2009 indicates that academic institutions produced the highest number of papers. Of these, 340 (3.4 %) were contributed by female scientists exclusively and 4,671 (47 %) were written jointly by male and female scientists. Women scientists produced about 0.36 papers per author, while their male counter parts produced 0.50 papers per author. Significant number of women scientists was first author and about 23 % were corresponding authors in papers written jointly by both sexes. Women scientists emphasized on the sub-discipline of cell biology and reproductive biology and male scientists emphasized on the sub-discipline of zoology. Women scientists work in small teams and have very less international collaborative papers. Women scientists publish in low impact factor and domestic journals and also are cited less as compared to their male counter parts.
