To explore issues of user interface design and experience, including culturally preferred design elements, a study was conducted analyzing sites in Germany, Japan, and the United States (30 municipal sites in each country). Design elements considered are use of symbols and graphics, color preferences, site features (links, maps, search functions, and page layout), language, and content. Significant modal differences were found in each of the listed categories. Outcomes from the study are used to discuss future research directions in the areas of experience design and localization.
