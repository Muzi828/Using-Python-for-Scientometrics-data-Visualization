Recent developments in Scandinavia may be of interest in relation to developing an integrated European research information structure that could provide the basis for an improved knowledge base for research policy. This article describes how reliable bibliographic data in institutional or national research information systems have been developed in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden with performance-based institutional funding models as a driver. It also discusses in more general terms the limitations and potentials of using data from research information systems in bibliometric analysis and in social studies of science.
