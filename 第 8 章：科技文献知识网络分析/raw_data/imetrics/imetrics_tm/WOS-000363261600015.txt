By employing the social network analysis technique, this study decomposed author and title keyword networks of the information technology management domain formed by 351 outlets, 914 institutions, 64 countries, 1913 authors, and thousands of keywords. The network and ego level properties-such as, degree centralities, density, components, and degree distribution-suggest that the keyword network exhibits power law distribution: a few popular keywords or themes are frequently used by follow-on studies. The study sheds light on the emerging and fading themes in the domain. In light of the analysis some important implications are discussed.
