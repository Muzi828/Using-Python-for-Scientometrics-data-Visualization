This article describes investigations into the publication behaviour of scientific authors from the GDR.  The obtained data revealed that - analogous to the Lotka-distribution - not only a fifth of all authors produce half of the publications of a certain institute, but that these authors also have a quicker reaction time and receptivity to new international research problems.  These findings may make it possible to substantiate proposals by guiding scientists in the direction of themes, respectively to help the science policy in the process of the elaboration of new research programs.
