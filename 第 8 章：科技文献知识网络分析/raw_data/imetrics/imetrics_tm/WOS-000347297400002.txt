Ranking journals is an important exercise in academia. While several approaches to rank journals exist, an inherent assumption of these approaches is that there is indeed a hierarchy of journals, which is captured by the methods used for ranking them. We address a more fundamental question: Is there a linear hierarchy within journals? In this article, we introduce the dominance ranking approach that investigates the extent of hierarchy in a given set of objects by examining the extent of intransitivity in the system of interactions. We test the efficacy of the approach to ranking information systems journals based on citation data spanning a 3 year period from 2009 to 2011. Results indicate that the approach is very effective in identifying the extent of hierarchy within journals, and subsequently in ranking the journals. With its statistical underpinnings, the approach brings greater objectivity to the ranking of journals than prior approaches.
