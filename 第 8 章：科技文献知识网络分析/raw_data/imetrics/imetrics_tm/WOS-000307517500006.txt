Whether singleton approach (citation analysis of identified source journals) used by Gross and Gross (Science 66(1713):385-389, 1927) or differential approach (citation analysis of articles in specific subject field) applied by Bradford (Engineering 137:85-86, 1934) suitable to select or rank journals in multifaceted subject-'Oceanography' is presented. This study discusses both the approaches analyzing citations of published literature in oceanography from 30 countries. The ranking correlation of journals showed better positive correlation (lowest rho = 0.662 for 2005-2009 to highest rho = 0.817 for 1995-1999) when top ranked journals from the list generated complying Gross and Gross approach (GA) were correlated with same journal titles of the list generated complying Bradford approach than the other way (lowest rho = 0.588 for 2005-2009 to highest rho = 0.726 for 1990-1994). Both the approaches matched similar number of journals to country-wise lists and give unbiased choice in preferring a ranking list. The journals distribution graphs showed typical Bradford-Leimkuhler curves in both the approaches for all the datasets. But the groos droop appears comparatively early with shorter straight line in GA. The high clustering of literature to limited number of journals is a disadvantage in multifaceted subject. So the differential approach used by Bradford is being considered suitable for multifaceted subject like, 'Oceanography'.
