This comparative study covers the period 1988-2003 of the Institute for Scientific Information Databases (ISI-DBs), CD-ROM edition: Science Citation Index (SCI), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI) as international databases and from the CubaCiencias (CubaCiencias) as an internal database. The number of articles published in Cuban journals, ISI-DBs, the author associativeness trend, the most important institutions and other indicators are collected. However, it is observed that CubaCiencias and ISI-DBs are not perfectly suitable for a study of the productivity of Cuban authors. It is necessary to properly standardize the author fields. For bibliometric studies, Cuba needs a database not only for the published papers in Cuban journals, but also for all the papers published by Cuban authors.
