Time dependence of bibliographic scattering is not at all understood. There are not many studies to establish any relation between growth of a bibliography over time and scattering. In this empirical study three different types of bibliographies have been taken. Each bibliography has been partitioned in different temporal periods (according as the particular bibliography should allow). The complete bibliography and the partitions have then been used to draw corresponding Bradford bibliographs whose natures have been studied. No conclusive relation between growth and scattering could be drawn except that the nature of the bibliograph depends on the value of concentration that is the ratio of the number of items and the number of sources in the bibliography. The paper shows that much needs to be done in this area and partition studies may be a useful technique.
