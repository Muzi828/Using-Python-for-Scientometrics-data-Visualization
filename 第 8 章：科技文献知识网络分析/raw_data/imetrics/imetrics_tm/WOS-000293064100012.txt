Consumer categorizations based on innovativeness were originally proposed by E. M. Rogers (2003) and remain of relevance for predicting purchasing behavior in high-tech domains such as consumer electronics. We extend such innovativeness-based categorizations in two directions: We first take into account the existence of technology clusters within product domains and then enrich the definition of consumer innovativeness by considering not only past adoption behavior but also future purchase intentions. We derive a novel consumer categorization based on data from a sample of 2,094 Dutch consumers for the case of consumer electronics. In so doing, we apply endogenous categorization techniques that represent a methodological improvement with respect to previously applied techniques.
