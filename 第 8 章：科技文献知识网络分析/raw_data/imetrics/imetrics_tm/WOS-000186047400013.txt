The aim of this paper is to propose a Vector Space Model as a new methodological approach which allows us to present the relationships between the elements of the Triple Helix Model (University, Industry, Government) in a spacial model by using the webpages of the National Research Councils of Germany and Spain as examples. Outlinks of the Biomedicine and Biology centres of these national councils were analysed with the intention of representing graphically these relationships through the Vector Space Model that allows for Multidimensional Scaling in three dimensions. Results show a map with the differences and similarities between the Spanish and German cases. It may be concluded that these results could become a qualitative indicator of a scientific and technical reality.
