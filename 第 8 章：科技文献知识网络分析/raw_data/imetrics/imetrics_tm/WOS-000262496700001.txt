In this paper we present a number of metrics for usage of the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System(ADS). Since the ADS is used by the entire astronomical community, these are indicative of how the astronomical literature is used. We will show how the use of the ADS has changed both quantitatively and qualitatively. We will also show that different types of users access the system in different ways. Finally, we show how use of the ADS has evolved over the years in various regions of the world. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
