The leaders of scientific groups appear in the last place (or in the first place) of the authors' lists of multi-author papers more often than other scientists (group-members).

The validity of assessment of the contributions of particular authors to the paper solely from their ranks in the authors' lists was challenged. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
