The paper deals with a scientometric analysis of publications from the journals ''Ecology'' and ''Ecologia'' (Russia) based on the frequencies of individual and cojoint encountering of ecological and mathematical keywords in these publications. Two main research approaches are revealed: population ecology and system ecology. The first one is used primarily in studies of plant communities, while the other in terrestrial animals and birds. Water communities are the subject of both approaches. The most spread mathematical methods are the methods of mathematical statistics which can be clustered into four groups: standard ones, multivariate methods, in particular multiple regression and multivariate analysis of variance, nonparametric or allowing deviations from normality, and methods of analysis of categorical data. Differential equations and stochastic process are used much lesser. The intensities of using mathematical methods are notably different in two journals.
