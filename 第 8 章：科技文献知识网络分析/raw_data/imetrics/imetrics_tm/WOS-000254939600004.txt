The paper was to establish an easy and effective method to investigate and develop a specific technological field from Japanese patent information. The walking technique of the biped humanoid robot was used as an example to study the relative research capabilities and patent citation conditions for patent owners and patent map by the searching method of the theme code for FI (File Index) and F-term classification system of the Japanese Patent Office (JPO). A formulated technical matrix of patent map was established to indicate that the ZMP (Zero Moment Point) control means was the main technology to achieve stabilized walking control of the humanoid biped robot. This method can aid to establish a specific technological matrix from the specific selected term codes (single viewpoint or multiple viewpoints) of the F-term list in the theme code of the JPO system through Boolean logical operations. The resulting particular technical fields were developed to improve the technological capability or seek the merging technology opportunities.
