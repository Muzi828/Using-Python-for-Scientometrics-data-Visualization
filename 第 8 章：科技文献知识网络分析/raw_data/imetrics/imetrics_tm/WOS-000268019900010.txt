This study analyses the bibliometric characteristics of the presentations at the 5th, 8th and 10th Conferences of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics, which were subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals covered by the Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation Index and LISA databases. 31.7% of all the papers presented at the three conferences were published. Scientometrics was the journal that published the highest proportions. A low rate of publication deprives researchers of potentially interesting results and points up the role of the ISSI Conference proceedings as a primary source of information.
