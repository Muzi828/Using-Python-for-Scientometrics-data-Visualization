This study examines patterns of authorship in nineteen Egyptian journals of agricultural science. Multiple authorship was found to be the predominant trend in the field and co-authored papers accounted for some 79 percent of the sample. The most common form of multiple authorship involved three people. Considerable variation was found among sub-fields and co-authorship was found to be most common in social-science related agricultural disciplines. The author found no significant differences in patterns of collaboration in the agricultural sciences in Egypt and two the other developing countries for which comparative data was available, India and Pakistan.
