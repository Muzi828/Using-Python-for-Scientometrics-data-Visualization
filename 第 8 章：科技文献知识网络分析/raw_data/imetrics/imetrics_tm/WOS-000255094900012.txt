We rank economics departments in the Republic of Ireland according to the number of publications, number of citations, and successive h-index of research-active staff. We increase the discriminatory power of the h(1)-index by introducing three generalizations, each of which is a rational number. The first (h(1)(+)) measures the excess over the actual h-index, while the other two (h(1)*, h(1)(Delta)) measures the distance to the next h-index. At the individual level, h* and h(Delta) coincide while h(+) is undefined.
