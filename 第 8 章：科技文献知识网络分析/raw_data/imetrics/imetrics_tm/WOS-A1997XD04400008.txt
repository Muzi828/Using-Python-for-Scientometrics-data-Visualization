Chemistry, as today's most active science, has increased its substances exponentially during the past 200 years without saturation. To get more insight why and how chemists produce new substances, a content analysis of 300 communications to the Angewandte Chemie of the years 1980, 1990, and 1995 is carried out regarding aims and methods of preparative research. In the most productive field of organic chemistry production mainly occurs to improve abilities for further production, while the less productive field of inorganic chemistry has more diverse aims. Methodological differences between organic and inorganic chemistry are discussed in detail as well as the relationship between pure and applied science.
