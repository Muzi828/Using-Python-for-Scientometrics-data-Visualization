An increase in the number of scientific publications in the last few years, which is directly proportional to the appearance of new journals, has made the researchers' job increasingly complex and extensive regarding the selection of bibliographic material to support their research. Not only is it a time consuming task, it also requires suitable criteria, since the researchers need to elect systematically the most relevant literature works. Thus the objective of this paper is to propose the methodology called Methodi Ordinatio, which presents criteria to select scientific articles. This methodology employs an adaptation of the ProKnow-C for selection of publications and the InOrdinatio, which is an index to rank by relevance the works selected. This index crosses the three main factors under evaluation in a paper: impact factor, year of publication and number of citations. When applying the equation, the researchers identify among the works selected the most relevant ones to be in their bibliographic portfolio. As a practical application, it is provided a research sample on the theme technology transfer models comprising papers from 1990 to 2015. The results indicated that the methodology is efficient regarding the objectives proposed, and the most relevant papers on technology transfer models are presented.
