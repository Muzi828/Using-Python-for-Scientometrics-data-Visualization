The predictive power of the h-index has been shown to depend on citations to rather old publications. This has raised doubts about its usefulness for predicting future scientific achievements. Here, I investigate a variant that considers only recent publications and is therefore more useful in academic hiring processes and for the allocation of research resources. It is simply defined in analogy to the usual h-index, but takes into account only publications from recent years, and it can easily be determined from the ISI Web of Knowledge.
