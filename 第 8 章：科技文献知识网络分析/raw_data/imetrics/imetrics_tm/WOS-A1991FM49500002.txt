This article is an attempt to identify the strengths and weakness of South African technology as they are manifested in patent analysis.  Using the "Technological Activity and Impact Indicators Database" of CHI Research/Computer Horizons, Inc., we identified the South African Innovation profile for the period 1975-1988.  Patents are analysed in their aggregate form in patent classes, Standard Industrial Classes and technologically similar classes.  The result indicates a shift of activity from low medium technology fields and a weakness in high technology fields.  Comparison of scientific and technological activity also reveals that South Africa contributes five times as much in international science than it does in technology.  Detailed analyses indicate the rise of a defence related industry in the country and reveal areas of emphasis and neglect.
