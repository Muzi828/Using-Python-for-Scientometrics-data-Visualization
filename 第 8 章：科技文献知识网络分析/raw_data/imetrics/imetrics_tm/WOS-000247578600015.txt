The MPEG-7 standard supports the description of both the structure and the semantics of multimedia; however, the generation and consumption of MPEG-7 structural and semantic descriptions are outside the scope of the standard. This article presents two research prototype systems that demonstrate the generation and consumption of MPEG-7 structural and semantic descriptions in retrieval applications. The active system for MPEGA video object simulation (AMOS) is a video object segmentation and retrieval system that segments, tracks, and models objects in videos (e.g., person, car) as a set of regions with corresponding visual features and spatiotemporal relations. The region-based model provides an effective base for similarity retrieval of video objects. The second system, the Intelligent Multimedia Knowledge Application (IMKA), uses the novel MediaNet framework for representing semantic and perceptual information about the world using multimedia. MediaNet knowledge bases can be constructed automatically from annotated collections of multimedia data and used to enhance the retrieval of multimedia.
