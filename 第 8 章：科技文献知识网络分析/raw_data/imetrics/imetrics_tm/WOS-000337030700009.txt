The Brazilian Lattes Platform is an important academic/resume data set that registers all academic activities of researchers associated with different major knowledge areas. The academic information collected in this data set is used to evaluate, analyze, and document the scientific production of research groups. Information about the interactions between Brazilian researchers in the form of coauthorships, however, has not been analyzed. In this article, we identified and characterized Brazilian academic coauthorship networks of researchers registered in the Lattes Platform using topological properties of graphs. For this purpose, we explored (a) strategies to develop a large Lattes curricula vitae data set, (b) an algorithm for identifying automatic coauthorships based on bibliographic information, and (c) topological metrics to investigate interactions among researchers. This study characterized coauthorship networks to gain an in-depth understanding of the network structures and dynamics (social behavior) among researchers in all available major Brazilian knowledge areas. In this study, we evaluated information from a total of 1,131,912 researchers associated with the eight major Brazilian knowledge areas: agricultural sciences; biological sciences; exact and earth sciences; humanities; applied social sciences; health sciences; engineering; and linguistics, letters, and arts.
