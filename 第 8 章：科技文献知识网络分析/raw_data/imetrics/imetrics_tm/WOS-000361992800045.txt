A bibliometric analysis was conducted to assess the trend of microbial risk assessment publications indexed in Scopus from 1973 to 2015. The study was analyzed the distribution of languages, countries, journals, author keywords, authorship pattern, and co-authorship relationships. An exponentially increasing trend (R-2 = 0.98) by 14.72 % article production per year was seen from 1973 to 2015. Risk Anal., Int. J. Food Microbiol. and J. Water Health were published the most papers. United States with 618 articles (78.23 %), Netherlands; 151 articles (19.11 %) and Australia; 135 articles (17.09 %) played active roles in the publication. Ashbolt NJ (3.16 %) from Alberta University and Haas CN from Drexel University (3.16 %) were the most productive authors in this field. The English language was dominant language of all publications (94.18 %). The analysis of author keywords revealed that foods and drinking waters are the most important environment media those are related to the transmission of microbial contamination. An upward trend in the number of articles reveals to be continuing in the future. Given the importance of microbial risk assessment, this trend reflects an increasing attention to the issue of microbial risk assessment among the scientists. It is hoped that transferring the experiences of developed countries in this field to less-developed countries may increases the number of researches in this field. It is expected this study could be the basis for a better understanding and development of researches related to microbial risk assessment worldwide.
