We analyze and evaluate the information provided by Spanish public universities on the web about their assessment and quality processes with the aim of detecting aspects for improvement and identifying best practices in universities that could act as a benchmark for the rest of the sector. A tested model/template incorporating a set of criteria and indicators is used to determine the quality of this information. The strengths and weaknesses of institutional websites are analyzed at both individual level and as a whole; the possible relation between website quality and the characteristics of the universities is also examined.
