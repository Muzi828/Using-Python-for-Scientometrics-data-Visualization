This paper presents a proposal of CERIF data model extension for evaluation of scientific research results. The data model extension is based on the CERIF semantic layer which enables classification of entities and relations between entities according to some classification scheme. The proposed data model was created using PowerDesigner CASE tool. The model is represented using a physical data model in the conceptual notation that is adopted in literature for representing the CERIF data model. This model is verified using the rule book for evaluation and quantitative expression of scientific research results of researchers employed at University of Novi Sad.
