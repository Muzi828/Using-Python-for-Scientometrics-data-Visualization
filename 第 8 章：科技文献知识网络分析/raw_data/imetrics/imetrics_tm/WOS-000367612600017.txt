In a previous publication the journal sub-impact factor denoted as SIF, and derived sub-impact sequences have been introduced. Their calculation included a discrete step. Now we adapt this scheme to include an interpolation procedure. A mathematical proof is given showing that anomalies that may happen in the discrete approach cannot happen anymore in the interpolated approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
