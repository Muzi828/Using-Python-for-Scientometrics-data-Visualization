This note attempts to approximate the distribution function for the number of innovation activities (NIA) in the manufacturing sector using the dataset of 2002 Korean Innovation Survey. The mixture model applied here can easily capture the bimodality feature of the NIA distribution and provide some useful information such as the mean of NIA and the effect of a firm's characteristic on whether the firm will undertake innovation activity.
