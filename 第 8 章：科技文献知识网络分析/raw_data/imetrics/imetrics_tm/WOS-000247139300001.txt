In previous research we examined the science base of US biotechnology utilizing several unique patent and scientific paper databases (MCMILLAN et al., 2000). Our findings highlighted the importance of public science in this industry. In this current research effort, we extend that analysis to include the subsequent citations those biotechnology patents received. Our conclusions are that the reliance on public science is stable when adjusted for forward citations, but the impact of different funding sources does change when citation weights are added. The science policy implications of these findings and future research opportunities are discussed.
