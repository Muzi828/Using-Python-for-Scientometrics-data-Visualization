In this study, our aim is to evaluate the global scientific publications produced in the field of food allergy over the past 14 years. The Web of Science was considered as the primary database consisting of both Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index. This analysis provides an insight into the number of papers, journals, subjects, citations and the overall trend of research. A total of 8327 articles were considered for this study published between 2001 and 2014 in over a hundred journals. There has been a growing concern in the population as the food allergies are on an alarming rise over the past decade. Till date, research has failed to come up with a solution for this issue except for a complete abstinence of that food/ingredient from the diet. This new Bibliometric method would help the researchers in this field to understand the landscape of food allergy research, and set up the future research direction.
