We present a model in which scientists compete with each other in order to acquire status for their publications in a two-step-process: first, to get their work published in better journals, and second, to get this work cited in these journals. On the basis of two Maxwell-Boltzmann type distribution functions of source publications we derive a distribution function of citing publications over source publications. This distribution function corresponds very well to the empirical data. In contrast to all observations so far, we conclude that this distribution of citations over publications, which is a crucial phenomenon in scientometrics. is not a power law, but a modified Bessel-function.
