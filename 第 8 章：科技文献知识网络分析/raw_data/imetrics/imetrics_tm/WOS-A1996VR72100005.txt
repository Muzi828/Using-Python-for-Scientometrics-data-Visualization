A set of scientometric indicators of interdisciplinary links between advancing fields of biomedicine is suggested. Twenty journals listed in the JCR of the SCI for 1988 are analyzed. An index of interdisciplinarity for a given journal is calculated as the sum of ratios between the numbers of journals from all other disciplines (except for general-scientific and miscellaneous journals) and from the same discipline cited by that journal or citing it, and of ratios between the numbers of citations to and by these journals. Some interdisciplinary patterns of 20 andrology journal articles are scientometrically assessed, too. The combined usage of this method with coclassification and co-citation methodology can optimize interdisciplinarity evaluation and promotion.
