This study aims to explore the relationship between science and technology via analyzing cross citations between papers and patents in fuel cells. To calculate cross citation indicators, papers were retrieved from the WOS database and patent data from the USPTO during the period between 1991 and 2010, resulting in a total of 20,758 papers and 8112 patents. This study shows that there is a gradually increasing convergence between science and technology, particularly of science linkage in recent years. Papers citing patents are more time-sensitive than patents citing papers. Academic institutions are more likely to cite papers and patents published by other academic institutions.
