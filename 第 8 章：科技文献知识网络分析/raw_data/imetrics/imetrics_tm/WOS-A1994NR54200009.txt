This paper presents a methodology of analysis of scientometric data reflecting dynamics of technology-oriented R & D. The data base contains a range of articles, patents and standards in the field of welding technologies world-wide and covers the period from 1961 to 1989. The methodology allows to identify the current phase of a technology life cycle in a given country or company and to compare it to that of the leading countries. These data allow to make more motivated decisions in science policy and R & D management.
