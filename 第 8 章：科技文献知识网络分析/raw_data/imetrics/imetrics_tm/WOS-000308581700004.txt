'Discometrics', a long neglected area of informetric studies was revisited in a network context. Cooperation between jazz musicians was analysed using the recent 'Hirschian' concepts of network informetrics. Partnership Ability Index (phi) was found to be a useful measure to characterize the way performers are embedded in their partnership network. Indications of some positive relations between phi and other 'qualities' of the performers were found. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
