A fair assessment of merit is needed for better resource allocation in the scientific community. We analyzed the performance of the institutional h-index in the case of Brazilian Psychiatry Post-graduation Programs. Traditional bibliometric indicators and the institutional h-index similarly ranked the programs, except for the Average Impact Factor. The institutional h-index correlated strongly with the majority of the traditional bibliometric indicators, which did not occur with the Average Impact Factor. The institutional h-index balances "quantity" and "quality", and can be used as part of a panel of bibliometric indicators to aid the peer-review process.
