The article explains why the concept of the user in Library and Information Science (LIS) user studies and information seeking behavior is theoretically inadequate and it proposes a reconceptualization of subjects, objects, and their relations according to a model of 'double mediation.' Formal causation (affordances) is suggested as a substitute for mechanistic causation. The notion of 'affective causation' is introduced. The works of several psychoanalysts and continental and Anglo-American philosophers are used as tools to develop the model.
