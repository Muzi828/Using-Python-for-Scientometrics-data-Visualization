We report OST experience on macro-indicators producing, especially on academic science and ISI sources. This task requires a combination of organizational choices for data handling and processing, and of bibliometric choices for a selection of indicators appropriate to the missions. Both aspects are briefly studied: the OST database, which also contains non-bibliometric datasets, is organized on the relational principle (RDBMS). Bibliometric indicators selected are classical ones, with a stress on overall coherence. In conclusion, standardization issue is briefly discussed. Standardization may not be desirable at the same extent for different targets (data, nomenclatures, indicators, procedures, etc.) and must not hinder further research. Natural process of communication and explicitation may also lead to fruitful convergences, without freezing supposed ''best ways''.
