This study explores an image-based retrieval interface for drug information, focusing on usability for a specific population-seniors. Qualitative, task-based interviews examined participants' health information behaviors and documented search strategies using an existing database (www.drugs.com) and a new prototype that uses similarity-based clustering of pill images for retrieval. Twelve participants (aged 65 and older), reflecting a diversity of backgrounds and experience with Web-based resources, located pill information using the interfaces and discussed navigational and other search preferences. Findings point to design features (e.g., image enlargement) that meet seniors' needs in the context of other health-related information-seeking strategies (e.g., contacting pharmacists).
