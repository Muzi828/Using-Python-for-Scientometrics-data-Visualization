Journal impact factor (JIF) has been used for journal evaluation over a long time, but also accompanied by the continuing controversy. In this study, a new indicator, the Journal's Integrated Impact Index (JIII) has been proposed for journal evaluation. In the JIII, one journal's average citations per paper, total citations, and all journals' average level of average citations per paper and total citations have been used to characterize the integrated impact of journals. Some contrastive analyses were carried out between JIII and JIF. The results show some interesting properties of the new indicator, and also reveal some relevant relationships among JIII, JIF, and other bibliometric indicators.
