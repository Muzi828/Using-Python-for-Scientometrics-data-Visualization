This paper investigates the pattern of teaching and research performances, the relationship between them, and the convergence for Italian public HEIs in the period 2000-2010, by comparing different bootstrap robust non-parametric frontier estimators. Overall we find an efficiency improvement, mainly driven by research, whereas teaching efficiency increases only in the very first years of the sample period. We also ascertain a slightly positive relationship between research and teaching performances. Furthermore, we find that Italian HEIs converge, in the observed period, although research and teaching do it at a different pace. Our empirical findings are robust to alternative estimators and bootstrapped bias correction.
