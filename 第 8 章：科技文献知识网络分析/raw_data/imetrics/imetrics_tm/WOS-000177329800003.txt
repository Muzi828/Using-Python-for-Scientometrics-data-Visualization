Although Derwent Biotechnology Abstracts has been used in a variety of bibliometric studies, it has never undergone a systematic examination of its reliability and validity. The objective of this paper is to assess its quality for bibliometric studies attempting to analyse the evolution of biotechnology research, to map leading organizations, and to study the interaction between science and technology. The first part reviews the tools used in bibliometric studies of biotechnology and describes the Derwent Biotechnology Abstracts database. The second part is a case study of plant genetic research, with special emphasis on Canada.
