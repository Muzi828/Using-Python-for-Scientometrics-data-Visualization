This paper describes various problems which may occur in quantitative research evaluation. It is shown that problems already arise when trying to define such seemingly simple scientometric elements as "personnel" or "budget". This has major consequences on the construction of indicators. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that different data sources as well as different data and indicators result in different, sometimes even contradicting outcomes.
