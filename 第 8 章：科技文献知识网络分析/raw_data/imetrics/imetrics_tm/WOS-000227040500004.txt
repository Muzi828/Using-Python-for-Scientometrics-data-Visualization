Programs in global environmental change research call for sweeping international cooperation and the creation of global networks. This paper analyzes to what extent research institutions in the field of global environmental change have responded to this call. Several bibliometric indicators of internationalization are discussed. A German and a U.S. sample are compared. The results indicate that a very discernable trend of recent internationalization can be observed. This is in line with a general internationalization trend across all fields, but at a much higher level. Given the political emphasis on capacity building in developing countries in this research field, however, there is only weak evidence of a more encompassing globalization process which also includes marginal world regions. Finally, the internationalization trend does not coincide with de-nationalization.
