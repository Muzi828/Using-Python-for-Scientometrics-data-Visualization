Many authors have written about how exotic ants invaded the Atlantic islands of Madeira and negatively impacted or even completely exterminated its native ants, despite the lack of first hand observations concerning such impact. I examine how quotation error (misrepresentation of previous work) and citation copying (citing unexamined publications referred to by others) led to the origin and spread of the erroneous story of ant extinctions in Madeira. Quotation error and citation copying may be more common than most scientists realize, particularly when authors cite references that are written in languages they do not understand.
