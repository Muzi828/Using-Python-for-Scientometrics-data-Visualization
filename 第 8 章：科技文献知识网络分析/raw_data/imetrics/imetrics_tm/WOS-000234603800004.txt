Visualization with the algorithm of BibTechMon provides the out-degree as well as the in-degree. The analysis shows that both frequency and co-occurrences of objects (nodes in the network) support the idea of Kleinberg's algorithm. The analysis of the algorithm shows clearly that strongly linked scores lead the iteration to a convergence and give the highest weights. Therefore BibTechMon visualizes the results well.
