In this short communication we give critical comments on the paper of Perakakis et al. (Scientometrics 85(2):553-559, 2010) on "Natural selection of academic papers". The criticism mainly focusses on their unbalanced criticism of peer review and their negative evaluation of the link of peer review with commercial publishing.
