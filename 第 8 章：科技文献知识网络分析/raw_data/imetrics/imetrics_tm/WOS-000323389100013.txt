This research studied the role of knowledge organization in the process of decision making in the field of energy efficiency and rational use of energy (EERUE). Theoretical contributions to knowledge organization and decision making are stressed. We chose to work with a type of methodology known as multiple criteria decision making-Saaty's analytical hierarchies process (AHP). This made it possible to develop a detailed analysis of the decision-making process and arrive at a hierarchical model. The model provided a structure representing the studied field, where an order of priority could be given to the decision-making process. The knowledge derived may be used in other fields of study such as information retrieval and knowledge representation.
