The research questions are as follows: to what extent do Canadian medical school faculty members have person-to-person interactions with individuals working in public and private sector organizations? What are the characteristics of Canadian medical school faculty members who interact with individuals working in these work settings? Are these different network patterns complementary or substitute? The data used for this study are from a cross-sectional survey of Canadian medical school faculty members (n = 907). Structural multivariate ordered probit models were estimated to explore the characteristics of faculty members with different network patterns and to see if these network patterns are complementary or substitute. Study results suggest that the different network patterns considered in the study are not conflicting, but that some patterns correspond to different faculty member profiles.
