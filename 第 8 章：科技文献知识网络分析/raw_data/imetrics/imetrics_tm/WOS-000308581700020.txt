Most networks in information science appear as weighted networks, while many of them (e.g. author citation networks, web link networks and knowledge flow networks) are directed networks. Based on the definition of the h-degree, the directed h-degree is introduced for measuring both weighted networks and directed networks. After analyzing the properties and derived measures of the directed h-degree an actual application of LIS journals citation network is worked out. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
