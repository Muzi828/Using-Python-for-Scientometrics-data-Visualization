Many studies have tried to describe patterns of research collaboration through observing coauthorship networks. Those studies mainly analyze static networks, and most of them do not consider the development of networks. hi this study, we turn our attention to the development of personal collaboration networks. On the basis of an analysis from two viewpoints, i.e., growth in the number of collaborating partners and change in the relationship strength with partners, we describe and compare the characteristics of four different domains, i.e., electrical engineering, information processing, polymer science, and biochemistry.
