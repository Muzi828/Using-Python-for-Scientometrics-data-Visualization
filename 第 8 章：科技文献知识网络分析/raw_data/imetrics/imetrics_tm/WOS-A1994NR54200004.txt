In this paper we discuss the possible gaps between several subdisciplines in informetrics and between informetrics and other -metrics disciplines such as econometrics, sociometrics and so on. It is argued that in all these disciplines, common models exist which describe the main points of interest, We also show that many concrete problems in these disciplines can be formulated in the same way and hence have similar solutions. We can conclude with the statement that the possible gaps between these disciplines are smaller than what many researchers in these different areas may feel and hence that many research projects could be set up in a wider framework.
