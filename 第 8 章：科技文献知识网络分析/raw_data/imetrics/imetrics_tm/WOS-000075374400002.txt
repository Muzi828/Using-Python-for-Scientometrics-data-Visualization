Data were compiled and linearly correlated on the growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) with the academic chemical engineering literature over a recent 26-year period for five different English-speaking countries, namely, the United States, Canada, Great Britain, India and Australia. The publication figures were also scaled to the total number of chemical engineering schools in the country; furthermore, all of these data were normalized from zero to unity, using the figures far the most recent year (1996) as the denominators, and then correlated against each other in linear fashion. Resulting confidence levels were in excess of 99% for each of the individual five countries, as well as for the entire set of normalized data for all of the countries.
