In this study, we analyze the dynamic usage history of Nature publications over time using Nature metrics data. We conduct analysis from two perspectives. On the one hand, we examine how long it takes before the articles' downloads reach 50 %/80 % of the total; on the other hand, we compare the percentage of total downloads in 7, 30, and 100 days after publication. In general, papers are downloaded most frequently within a short time period right after their publication. And we find that compared with non-Open Access papers, readers' attention on Open Access publications are more enduring. Based on the usage data of a newly published paper, regression analysis could predict the future expected total usage counts.
