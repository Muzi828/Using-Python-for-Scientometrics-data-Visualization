The present study investigate to what extent basic-clinical collaboration and involvement in translational research improve performance of researchers, in the particular setting of hospitals affiliated with the Spanish National Health System (NHS). We used a combination of quantitative science indicators and perception-based data obtained through a survey of researchers working at NHS hospitals. Although collaborating with clinical researchers and health care practitioners may increase productivity of basic researchers working in clinical settings, the extent to which they are able to contribute to translational research is the factor that allows them to make a qualitative leap in their scientific production in highly ranked international scientific journals. Our results challenge the arguments by some authors that translational projects have more difficulties than basic proposals to be granted by funding agencies and to be published in high-impact journals. Although they are not conclusive, our results point towards the existence of a positive relationship between leadership and involvement in translational research. Basic-clinical collaboration and translational research should be an incentive for researchers as they are likely to favour their performance. Hospitals will benefit from encouraging researchers and health care practitioners to collaborate in the framework of translational projects, as a way to improve not only individual, but institutional research performance. Spanish hospitals should contribute to overcome obstacles to translational research, through the full integration of basic researchers within the hospital setting and the definition of a research career path within the NHS.
