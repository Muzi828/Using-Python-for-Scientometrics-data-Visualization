This article introduces the generalized Kosmulski-indices as a new family of scientific impact measures for ranking the output of scientific researchers. As special cases, this family contains the well-known Hirsch-index h and the Kosmulski-index h ((2)). The main contribution is an axiomatic characterization that characterizes every generalized Kosmulski-index in terms of three axioms.
