This paper analyses the reasons, framework and trends of scientific cooperation between Israeli and foreign researchers for the period 1974-1983. The study used the ISI database purchased by the S. Neaman Institute, containing all Israeli publications for the above mentioned years. A complementary survey was carried out including a sample of two academic institutions. The survey database established on the basis of replies of 249 researchers who replied to the survey questionnaires includes data regarding 5,893 papers, 1550 of which had not been included in the ISI database. The findings show that about one third of the papers missing from the ISI database is due to the fact that authors did not note their permanent Israeli address under the paper's title. Other reasons for the partial coverage of the ISI database is that the ISI database does not cover all the professional journals and all types of scientific publications. The survey points to an absolute increase of the actual bulk of the research performed by Israeli scientists abroad. Major differences were found between researchers among different departments as regards framework for research performed abroad, reasons and sources of funding. The main reason listed for foreign cooperation was that of true cooperation (50%) and this is a very positive phenomenon.
