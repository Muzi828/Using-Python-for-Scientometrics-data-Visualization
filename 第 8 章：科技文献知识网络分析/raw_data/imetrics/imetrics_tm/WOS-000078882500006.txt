The fundamentals have been developed for a quantitative theory on the structure and dynamics of scientific networks. These fundamentals were conceived through a new vision of translation, defined mathematically as the derivative or gradient of the quality of the actors as a function of the coordinates for the space in which they perform. If we begin with the existence of a translation barrier, or an obstacle that must be overcome by the actors in order to translate, and if we accept the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution as representative of the translating capacity of the actors, it becomes possible to demonstrate the known principle of "success breeds success. We also propose two types of elemental translations: those which are irreversible and those which are in equilibrium. In addition, we introduce the principle of composition, which enables, from elemental translations, the quantification of more complex ones.
