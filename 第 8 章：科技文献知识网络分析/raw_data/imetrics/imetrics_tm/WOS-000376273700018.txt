Bibliometric analyses depend on the quality of data sets and the author name disambiguation process (ANDP), which attributes author names on papers to real persons. Errors in a data set or the ANDP result in wrongly attributed papers to the wrong person. These errors can potentially distort the results of analyses based on such data sets. However, the general impact of data set quality on bibliometric analysis is mostly unknown; as such, an assessment is costly due to the manual steps involved. This paper presents an overview of the data set qualities produced by different ANDPs and uses simulations to study the general impact of data set quality on different bibliometric analysis (author rankings and regressions analysis with number of papers as dependent variable). The results show that rankings of authors are only valid on high quality data sets, which are typically not found directly in commercially available datasets. Both mean and individual per person data set quality is important for valid ranking results. Regressions are not as influenced by the overall data set quality but instead by individual quality differences between authors. Different types of errors can potentially bias the regression results. The outcome of this study also shows the importance of reporting both overall and individual variation in data set quality, so that the validity of analyses based on these data sets can be assessed.
