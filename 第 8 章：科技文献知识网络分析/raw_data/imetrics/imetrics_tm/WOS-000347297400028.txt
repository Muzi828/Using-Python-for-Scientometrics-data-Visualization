This article examines the conceptual evolution of qualitative research in the field of marketing from 1956 to 2011, identifying the main themes and applications for which it has been used and the trends for the future. Science mapping analysis was employed, using co-word networks in a longitudinal framework. Science mapping analysis differs from other tools in that it includes the use of bibliometric indicators. The great number of studies published makes it possible to undertake a conceptual analysis of how qualitative marketing research has evolved. To show the conceptual evolution of qualitative marketing research, four study periods were chosen. The results made it possible to identify eight thematic areas that employ qualitative research in the field of marketing: Consumer behaviour, Supply chain management, Dynamic capabilities, Methodology, Media, Business to business marketing, International Marketing and Customer Satisfaction.
