This article examines the influence of task type on the users' preferred level of document elements (full articles, sections, or subsections) during interaction with an XML-version of Wikipedia. We found that in general articles and subsections seemed to be the most valuable elements for our test subjects. For information-gathering tasks, this tendency was stronger, whereas for fact-finding tasks, the sections seemed to play a more important role. We assume from this that users select different information search strategies for the two task types. When dealing with fact-finding tasks, users seem more likely to use one single element as an answer, while when they do information gathering, they pick information from several elements.
