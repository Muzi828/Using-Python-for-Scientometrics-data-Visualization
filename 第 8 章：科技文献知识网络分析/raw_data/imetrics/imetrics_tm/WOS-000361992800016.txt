Taking the theses' keywords in China from 1986 to 2014 as the research materials, use the basis concept of the Big Data Theory to further study the keywords which related to oil and gas industry. Analyze the keywords frequency of the theses in oil and gas industry and its co-occurrence frequency pair, and then use the theory of mapping knowledge domain to visualize the keywords co-occurrence network in petroleum industry so as to make further research of the heated issues that mapping knowledge domain has shown. According to the research we can see that the application technology R&D (research and development) predominate the oil and gas industry, featuring a high concentration and long tail phenomenon (which means various researches focus on different kinds of things, the scale of the research is large).
