Effort has been made in this case study to find out the ways to achieve maximum citations. In this study, top 50 medical institutes have been selected through the 'Scopus' database on the basis of the performance of their research output during 2003-2012. The main objective of this study was to find out the factors which are impacting the citations of the health professionals in India and how to make them aware to increase the positive impact which will help them in improving their citation count. Findings of the study show that the publications produced with international collaboration get published in international journals easily and received more citations than the publications published in Indian journals. A positive relationship between highly cited papers and international collaborative papers has been established. India has also showed good growth in medical literature produced with international collaboration.
