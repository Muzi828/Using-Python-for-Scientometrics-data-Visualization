The citer h-index of a researcher (introduced by Ajiferuke and Wolfram) was found to have a strong linear relationship with the h-index of this researcher. This finding of Franceschini, Maisano, Perotti and Proto also revealed, experimentally, that the slope of this straight line (passing through the origin) is strictly larger than one. In this paper we present a rationale for this empirical result of this author on the relation between the h-index before and after a transformation of the citation data.
