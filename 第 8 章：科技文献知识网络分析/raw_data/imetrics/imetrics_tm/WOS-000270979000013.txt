Based on two large data samples from ISI databases, the author evaluated the Hirsch model, the Egghe-Rousseau model, and the Glanzel-Schubert model of the h-index. The results support the Glanzel-Schubert model as a better estimation of the h-index at both journal and institution levels. If h (c) , h (p) and h (pc) stand for the Hirsch estimation, Egghe-Rousseau estimation, and Glanzel-Schubert estimation, respectively, then an inequality h (p) < h similar to h (pc) < h (c) holds in most cases.
