With increasing sophistication in technology has emerged a growing interest in accessing images for personal and work purposes. In this research we investigated the use of images as data-for the information contained within the image, and as an object to illustrate. Thirty journalists and historians from academic and professional work settings were interviewed using a series of semistructured questions regarding how they use images (for information or for illustration) and the types of image attributes used to describe an appropriate image for their work. This was done within the context of a work task model used by this group to understand how images are used throughout the process of completing a typical written work task. Findings suggest that the stage of the work task process has a significant impact on how the image is used (information or illustration). Participants use as many descriptive as conceptual image attributes to locate an image, but, interestingly, there are no significant differences according to use for information or illustration purposes. This study increases our understanding of the function of images in the written work task process, and provides new knowledge about the conceptual and descriptive attributes that are most valued.
