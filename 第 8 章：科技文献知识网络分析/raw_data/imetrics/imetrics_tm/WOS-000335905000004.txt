This paper demonstrates that basic research has been overshadowed by applied research in China for decades, from the perspective of S&T policy. The data involves 4,707 Chinese S&T policies during the period between 1949 and 2010, which are grouped into five phases, based on the process of S&T system reform in China. We also found that S&T policies in China are leaning more towards basic research, and the gap between basic research and applied research is shrinking.
