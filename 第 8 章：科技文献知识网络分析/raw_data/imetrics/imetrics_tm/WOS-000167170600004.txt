This paper deals with knowledge sharing over Internet. After defining the concept, we will discuss work aimed at creating a technical system to implement it and at measuring the quality of results obtained. However, the reader will quickly see that the text is organized to address the theme of this special issue of Scientometrics. Models, methods and measures characterize scientometric research. What problems arise in attempting to develop them for internet? In order to answer this question, it is important to distinguish between two schools of practice in the scientometric research field: the first derives fi om applied statistics and is called bibliometrics; the second derives from cognitive sociology and is called infometrics (Turner, 1994).
