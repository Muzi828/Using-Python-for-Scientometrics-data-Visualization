A comprehensive database, the Cumulative Index of Geophysics for the period 1936-1985 was analysed to study collaborative and authorship trends in exploration geophysics. A total of 3,417 publications in Geophysics and 1,318 publications in Geophysical Prospecting comprise the database. About 56.2% of all the publications were found to be single-authored items. The number of single-authored items has been gradually declining from 1936 to 1985. Authorship per item for the period was found to be 1.6 which has increased from 1.17 per item during 1936-1950 to 1.9 per item during 1981-1985. The results of this study reveal that like in any other discipline in sciences, collaboration in exploration geophysics research has also been increasing during the period 1936-1985.
