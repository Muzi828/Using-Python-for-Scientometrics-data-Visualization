Using sample data from the MathSciNet database from 1985 to 2000, we constructed the database and computer searching system of China's international cooperation in publication with other countries (or regions), and applied the international standard measure indexes of cooperation. The paper gives systematic scientific measure and evaluation of international mathematical research, especially for China. It also presents a matrix model of the cooperation network. During the 16 years, the trend toward cooperation of international mathematical research has increased substantially. The number of internationally co-authored papers increased at a speed of 6.99% per year in the word and at 15.91% per year in China.
