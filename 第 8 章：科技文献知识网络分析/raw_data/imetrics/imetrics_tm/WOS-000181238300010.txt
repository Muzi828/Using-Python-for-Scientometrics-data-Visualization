Knowledge domain visualization is a visual exploratory approach to the study of the development of a knowledge domain. In this study, we focus on the practical issues concerning modeling and visualizing scientific revolutions. We study the growth patterns of specialties derived from citation and cocitation data on string theory in physics. Special attention is given to the two superstring revolutions since the 1980s. The superstring revolutions are visualized, animated, and analyzed using the general framework of Thomas Kuhn's structure of scientific revolutions. The implications of taking this approach are discussed.
