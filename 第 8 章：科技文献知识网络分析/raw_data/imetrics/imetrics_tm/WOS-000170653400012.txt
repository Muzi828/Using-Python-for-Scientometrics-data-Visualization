This article describes ways of automatically generating 15 kinds of personal profiles of authors from bibliographic data on their publications in databases. Nicknamed CAMEOs, the profiles can be used for retrieval of documents by human searchers or computerized agents. They can also be used for mapping an author's subject matter (in terms of descriptors, identifiers, and natural language) and studying his or her publishing career. Finally, they can be used to map the intellectual and social networks evident in citations to and from authors and in co-authorships.
