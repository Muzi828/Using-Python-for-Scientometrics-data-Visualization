I propose the use of h-plots for visualizing the asymmetric relationships between the citing and cited profiles of journals in a commonmap. With this exploratory tool, we can understand better the journal's dual roles of citing and being cited in a reference network. The h-plot is introduced and its use is validated with a set of 25 journals belonging to the statistics area. The relatedness factor is considered for describing the relations of citations from a journal "i" to a journal "j," and the citations from the journal "j" to the journal "i." More information has been extracted from the h-plot, compared with other statistical techniques for modelling and representing asymmetric data, such as multidimensional unfolding.
