Comparative assessment of scientometric indicators is greatly hindered by the different standards valid in different science fields and subfields. Indicators concerning to different fields can be compared only after first gauging them against a properly chosen reference standard, and their relative standing can then be compared. Methods of selecting reference standards and scaling procedures are surveyed in this study, and examples are given to their practical application.
