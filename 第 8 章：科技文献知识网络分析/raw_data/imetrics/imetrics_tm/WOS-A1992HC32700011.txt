The aim of this project was to evaluate research groups working in the broad field of plant biomass in the areas outside the USA and the EC.  The assessment had two key elements:  the measurement of scientific productivity and the investigation of factors affecting research performance.  Research groups were identified from a range of information sources.  Data on funding, information access, staffing, publication policy and degree of awareness of other research groups in the field were collected during the course of interviews.  Two approaches - bibliometric analysis and peer review - were examined as a means of constructing indicators for assessing research output.
Following a critical review of the use of bibliometric indicators in peripheral countries, the results from a study of eight countries are presented.  Neither of two indicators employed proved to be a particularly successful method of evaluating research, and this finding is discussed in relation to publication patterns, the nature of the research community and the research field under study.  Finally, the use of a "peripatetic expert" was found to have some value as a means of assessment.
