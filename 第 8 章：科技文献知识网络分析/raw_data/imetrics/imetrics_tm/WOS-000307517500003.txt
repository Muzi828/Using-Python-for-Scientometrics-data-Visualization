This article provides an empirical assessment of the performance of the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in terms of science, technology, and innovation. This study is relevant because it employs a larger data set, examines more countries, and covers more years than previous studies. The results indicate that these countries had differing patterns of performance, and the pattern of growth among them was asymmetrical. Additional findings suggest that these countries performed idiosyncratically with respect to the six quantitative dimensions we examined. Our research includes a form of comparative policy evaluation that might assist the monitoring of the implementation of "Vision 2020". The results simplify how we determine the relative strengths and weaknesses of national innovation systems and are relevant to policy discussions. In relation to transferability, the findings demonstrate similarities to the European Union with regard to performance and governance.
