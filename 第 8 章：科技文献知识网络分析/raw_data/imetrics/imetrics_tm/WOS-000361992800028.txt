Understanding food webs is important and useful for planning environmental conservation, management and restoration. However, research on food webs is not uniform globally; it tends to be concentrated in specific areas or ecosystem types, and would hinder our understanding of food webs and ecosystem processes. This study examined the trends in food web research over the past decades by analysing publication data from Web of Science; in particular, it focused on the ecosystem types studied, countries in which the studies were done, and which countries collaborated on the studies. A total of 20,239 publications were examined. The results showed that research on food webs has dramatically increased since the 1990s. Most publications related focused on aquatic ecosystems. North American and European countries contributed much more in terms of research productivity than those from Africa and South America. Collaboration among individual authors and countries has become increasingly intensive. The USA and Canada were consistently the top two productive countries, and had the most frequent collaborations. Our study indicates that food webs from ecosystems other than aquatic ones, such as terrestrial ecosystems, also require more attention in the future; in particular those that exist within countries from Africa and South America.
