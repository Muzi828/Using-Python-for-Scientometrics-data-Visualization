An index is proposed that is based on the h-index and a 3-year publication/citation window. When updated regularly, it shows the current scientific performance of researchers rather than their lifetime achievement as indicated by common scientometric indicators. In this respect, the new rating scheme resembles established sports ratings such as in chess or tennis. By the example of ACM SIGMOD E.F. Codd Innovations Award winners and Priestley Medal recipients, we illustrate how the new rating can be represented by a single number and visualized.
