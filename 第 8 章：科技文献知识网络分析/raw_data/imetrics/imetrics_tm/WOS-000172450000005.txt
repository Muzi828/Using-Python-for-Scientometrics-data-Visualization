The equivalence of semantic networks with spreading activation and vector spaces with dot product is investigated under ranked retrieval. Semantic networks are viewed as networks of concepts organized in terms of abstraction and packaging relations. It is shown that the two models can be effectively constructed from each other. A formal method is suggested to analyze the models in terms of their relative performance in the same universe of objects.
