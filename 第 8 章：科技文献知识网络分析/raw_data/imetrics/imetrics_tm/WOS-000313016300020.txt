This paper explores the role of sectors in scientific research and development networks by drawing on bibliometric analyses and innovation systems and triple helix literatures. I conducted a bibliometric study of Vancouver Canada's worldwide infection and immunity network and examined network structure through sociograms, social network metrics, as well as relational contingency table and ANOVA network analyses. Universities are the key network sector followed by hospitals and government organisations. The private sector plays a weak role. Most sectors show a preference for collaborating within, as opposed to across, sectors. This trend is most pronounced in hospitals and least pronounced among firms. Hospitals and universities collaborate well above statistical expectations. I discuss the implications of these findings for future science policy and studies of research and development networks.
