This opinion piece considers the relative importance of individual and social factors in determining information behavior. It concludes that individual factors are more central and fundamental, although they may certainly be qualified by social and cultural factors and even though there are good reasons for studying and analyzing information behavior in terms of social groups. More studies of interesting emergent factors and behaviors in social settings would be valuable.
