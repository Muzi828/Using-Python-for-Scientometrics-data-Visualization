The objective of this paper is to show that various bibliometric indicators are a good departure point to describe a national research community, as well as the linkages between research institutions, the users of the research and the funders of the research community. We profile the Canadian coal and petroleum research communities. The role of CANMET, a government research laboratory, is examined as example of how our analysis can be useful to policy-makers and decision-makers.
