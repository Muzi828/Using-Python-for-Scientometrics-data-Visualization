The paper discusses techniques to emphasize patterns in citation data and to study their dynamics. In this context, the STATIS and the STATIS dual methods are presented. The methods are a generalization of the principal component analysis from a dynamical point of view. STATIS and its dual are applied in order to illustrate the dynamic of 'citing-cited patterns' by using citation data of sixteen major journals from the statistics field.
