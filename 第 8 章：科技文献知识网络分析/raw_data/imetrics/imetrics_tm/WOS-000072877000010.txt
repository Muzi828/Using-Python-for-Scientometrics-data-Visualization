The 1990-1996 publication activity of 10 medium-sized European countries in the leading journals of 37 life science disciplines and in the seven top general life science journals was investigated. For each country the number of leading disciplinary journal articles per 100000 inhabitants (intensity) was compared to the percentage of top journal articles (:effectivity). A high and significant correlation, i.e. quality heightening was found.
