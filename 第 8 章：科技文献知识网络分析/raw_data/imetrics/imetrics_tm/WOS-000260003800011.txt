The place of genealogy in present scientific research has been investigated by scientometric methods. The term "genealogy" and related words were searched in the title, keywords, and abstracts of science journals for the period 1975-2006. It was concluded that 1991 onward the number of articles about "applied" genealogy has increased dramatically, whereas that of classical (or "pure") genealogy only modestly. In contemporary science, the fields medicine and genetics are those who profit most from human genealogy. More than forty percent of the medical articles containing the search terms were from the neurology and oncology in the period investigated.
