We present the measure of quality introduced by the review team of Embrapa to evaluate its research projects. The quality measurement scheme comprises four different dimensions (External Validity, Internal Validity, Institutional Adequacy, and Formal Adequacy). The quality measurements are used as dependent variables in a multivariate effort to identify important factors necessary to improve overall as well as specific quality aspects.
