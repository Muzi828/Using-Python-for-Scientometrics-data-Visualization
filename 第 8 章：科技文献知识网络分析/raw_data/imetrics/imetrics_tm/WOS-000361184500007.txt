In this article we argue for how a genre-theoretical approach to information history can contribute to our understanding of what has historically been conceived of as information, what sort of networks and activities triggered the production and use of information, and what forms information was presented and communicated in. Through 2 case studies we show how information and the genres used for communicating that information was perceived and used by the relevant agents involved with the genres. Based on the case studies, we conclude by discussing how the fields of information history and rhetorical genre theory can inform each other.
