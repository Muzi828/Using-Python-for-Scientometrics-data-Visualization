Quality evaluation and its assurance in higher education institutions constitute an obligation and scope of most European Universities. To accomplish this, quantitative indices, known as bibliometrics, are recruited which are considered a useful evaluation tool particularly for academics' and Universities' research performance. In the present study, the research quality of the five Greek civil engineering departments (Athens, Patras, Thessaloniki, Volos, Xanthi) is assessed by means of several advanced bibliometric indices calculated separately for each academic. Statistical analysis of the data is also performed to compare the observed differences in the mean values of the calculated indices. The study is conducted both in department and academic rank level to explore how research activity is distributed among the various ranks. In addition, to evaluate the research status of the Greek departments in the European context, their research output is compared with that of London civil engineering department. To explore the dependence of bibliometrics on seniority, bibliometric analysis considering the research activity of all academics only during the last decade is also made. Finally, the temporal progress of the research productivity leads to interesting findings about the impact of the European economic crisis on research performance. In general, bibliometrics demonstrate that Patras department host academics of better quality, but Athens exhibits higher scientific activity over the last decade. Superiority of London department is evident but few bibliometrics are comparable with the ones of the Greek departments. Results also indicate that no common standards in hiring/promotion of academics are established, while the European socio-economic crisis has significant negative impact on research productivity.
