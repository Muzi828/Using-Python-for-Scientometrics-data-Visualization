Productivity and impact of the Spanish Council for Scientific Research scientists in Natural Resources and Chemistry by gender and professional category are analysed. Scientific publications were downloaded from the Science Citation Index, years 1994-1999. A total of 260 Natural Resources scientists (24% of females) and 219 Chemistry ones (38% of females) were studied. Productivity tended to increase as professional category improved in the two areas. Within each category no significant differences in productivity were found between genders, but the outliers with the highest production were mostly males. Distribution of females by professional categories and number of years at the institution were analysed to detect possible gender discrimination in the promotion system. A more positive picture e merges in Chemistry than in Natural Resources, since a process of feminization of that area has started in the lowest professional categories and females' progression to the upper ranks is expected in the near future.
