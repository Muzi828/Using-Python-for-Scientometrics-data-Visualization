Bibliometric research assessment has matured into a quantitative phase using more meaningful measures and analogies. In this paper, we propose a thermodynamic analogy and introduce what are called the energy, exergy and entropy terms associated with a bibliometric sequence. This can be displayed as time series (variation over time), or in event terms (variation as papers are published) and also in the form of phase diagrams (energy-exergy-entropy representations). It is exergy which is the most meaningful single number scalar indicator of a scientist's performance while entropy then becomes a measure of the unevenness (disorder) of the publication portfolio.
