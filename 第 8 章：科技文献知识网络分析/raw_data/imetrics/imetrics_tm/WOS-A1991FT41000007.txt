The citation motivations among 51 self citing authors in several natural science disciplines were investigated.  Results of a survey on reasons for both self citation and citation to others show that there are very few differences in motivation, and that there are plausible intellectual grounds for those differences which are substantial.  Analysis of exposure in text reveals virtually no differences between self citations and citations to others.  Analysis of individual disciplines also uncover no substantive differences in either motivation or exposure in text.
