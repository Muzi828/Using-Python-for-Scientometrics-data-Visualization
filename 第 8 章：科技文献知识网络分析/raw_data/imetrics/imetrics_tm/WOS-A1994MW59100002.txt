This investigation has three aims: 1. To direct the attention of scientometrics to the widespread use of citation indexes by practising lawyers. The analysis of this practice is of special value for comparative studies in scientometrics and informetrics. 2. To examine the frequency distribution of legal decision citations in the German jurisdiction. 3. To test whether these frequency distributions depend exclusively on the density of citations between documents of a database, as stated by D. Price.
