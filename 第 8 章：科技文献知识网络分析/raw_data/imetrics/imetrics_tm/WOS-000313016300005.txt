Because some cited references are not relevant to the citing patent and not all the relevant references are cited, the study attempts to use the bibliographic coupling (BC) approach to filter the irrelevant patent citations and supplement the relevant uncited patent citations to construct a patent citation network (PCN). The study selected the field of electric vehicle technology to explore the phenomenon and examined the characteristics of PCNs in terms of the average BC strength and the average citation time lag. Four PCNs were constructed in this study. The aggregated PCN (APCN) excluded the irrelevant patent citations and added the relevant uncited patent citations, which has brought out significant improvement. The APCN became more concentrated and the information which reserved in the APCN was the most current. Additionally, some invisible technology clusters and relationships were also manifested in the APCN.
