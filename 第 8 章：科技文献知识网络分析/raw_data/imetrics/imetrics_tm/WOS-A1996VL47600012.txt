Recent Swedish publication-based doctoral dissertations by medical practitioners contained an average of four published papers and one manuscript per theses. The average number of authors per paper was four. The candidate was the first author on 83% of papers indicating that the same paper was not used to support several theses. 82% of the candidates had completed their specialist training: 24% of these were women; surgeons were the biggest single group. The average age in years was: surgeons 40 (34-48); non-surgeons 41 (34-49); and 35 (32-36) for those who had just completed their basic post-qualification registration. These findings are in keeping with the Swedish tradition of scientific and evidence based medicine.
