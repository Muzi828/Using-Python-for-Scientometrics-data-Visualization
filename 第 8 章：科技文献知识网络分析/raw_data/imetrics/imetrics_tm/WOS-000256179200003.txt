The objective of this study was to characterize the types of tissue-centric users based on tissue use, requirements, and their job or work-related variables at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), Pittsburgh, PA. A self-reporting questionnaire was distributed to biomedical researchers at the UPMC. Descriptive and cluster analyses were performed to identify and characterize the complex types of tissue-based researchers. A total of 62 respondents completed the survey, and two clusters were identified based on all variables. Two distinct groups of tissue-centric users made direct use of tissue samples for their research as well as associated information, while a third group of indirect users required only the associated information. The study shows that tissue-centric users were composed of various types. These types were distinguished in terms of tissue use and data requirements, as well as by their work or research-related activities.
