We introduce a new technique for quantifying and monitoring the effect a given set of time series has on the evolution of a single time series. The technique relies on the causal nature of this effect, and expresses the result in terms of partial and cross elasticities. As an application, we consider the case where the single time series consists of the number of patents filed over time, in a given category, and where the set of time series consists of the numbers of scientific articles published over time, for each one of a number of science domains. Finally, we use a quiver map for visualizing the elasticities and as a case study we illustrate our methodology on patents in the field of Biotechnology.
