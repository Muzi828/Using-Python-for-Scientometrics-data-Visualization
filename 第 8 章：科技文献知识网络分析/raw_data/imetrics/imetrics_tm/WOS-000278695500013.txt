An article assessment system based on both Tianjin University and nine key Chinese Universities' academic disciplinary benchmarks was established to evaluate researcher's published papers. With this scientific benchmarking system, the quality of a researcher's papers could be easily located in a percentile scale in corresponding field within certain groups. Several factors, including total number of papers, order of authors, impact of journals, citation count, h-index, e-index, a-index, m-quotient, etc., were also utilized for both quantity and quality analysis. Furthermore, the novel proposed weighted citation analysis was introduced to judge a researcher's contribution to his/her research outcomes. The convenient application and comprehensive evaluation property of this assessment system was thoroughly discussed via a given example.
