This article reports on a quantitative categorical analysis of metadata elements in the Dublin Core, VRA Core, REACH, and EAD metadata schemas, all of which can be used for organizing and describing images. The study found that each of the examined metadata schemas contains elements that support the discovery, use, authentication, and administration of images, and that the number and proportion of elements supporting functions in these classes varies per schema. The study introduces a new schema comparison methodology and explores the development of a class-oriented functional metadata schema for controlling images across multiple domains.
