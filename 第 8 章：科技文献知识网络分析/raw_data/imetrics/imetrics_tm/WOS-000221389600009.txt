We explore perceived creativity in scholarship as it relates to scholarly reputation in the field of management. The effects of quantity (total refereed publications, national paper presentations) and quality (proportion of articles in premier journals, editorial activity, research awards) dimensions of scholarly activity are also considered. Our results suggest that the quality dimensions are positively associated with reputation, but that the perceived creativity of a scholar's work further influences reputation, and partially mediates the relationship between some quality measures and reputation. These results suggest that quality, creativity in particular, is more important than quantity for the accumulation of reputation.
