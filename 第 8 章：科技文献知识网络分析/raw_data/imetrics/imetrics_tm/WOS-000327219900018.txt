Thanks to a unique individual dataset of French academics in economics, we explain individual publication and citation records by gender and age, co-authorship patterns (average number of authors per article and size of the co-author network) and specialisation choices (percentage of output in each JEL code). The analysis is performed on both EconLit publication scores (adjusted for journal quality) and Google Scholar citation indexes, which allows us to present a broad picture of knowledge diffusion in economics. Citations are largely driven by publication records, which means that these two measures are partly substitutes, but citations are also substantially increased by larger research team size and co-author networks.
