This paper describes a clustering and authorship attribution study over the State of the Union addresses from 1790 to 2014 (224 speeches delivered by 41 presidents). To define the style of each presidency, we have applied a principal component analysis (PCA) based on the part-of-speech (POS) frequencies. From Roosevelt (1934), each president tends to own a distinctive style whereas previous presidents tend usually to share some stylistic aspects with others. Applying an automatic classification based on the frequencies of all content-bearing word-types we show that chronology tends to play a central role in forming clusters, a factor that is more important than political affiliation. Using the 300 most frequent word-types, we generate another clustering representation based on the style of each president. This second view shares similarities with the first one, but usually with more numerous and smaller clusters. Finally, an authorship attribution approach for each speech can reach a success rate of around 95.7% under some constraints. When an incorrect assignment is detected, the proposed author often belongs to the same party and has lived during roughly the same time period as the presumed author. A deeper analysis of some incorrect assignments reveals interesting reasons justifying difficult attributions.
