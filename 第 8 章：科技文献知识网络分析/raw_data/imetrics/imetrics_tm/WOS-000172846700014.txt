The growing importance of collaboration in research and the still underdeveloped state-of-the-art of research on collaboration have encouraged scientists from 16 countries to establish a global interdisciplinary research network under the title "Collaboration in Science and in Technology" (COLLNET) with Berlin as its virtual centre which has been set up on January Ist, 2000. The network is to comprise the prominent scientists, who work at present mostly in the field of quantitative science studies. The intention is to work together in co-operation both on theoretical and applied aspects.
