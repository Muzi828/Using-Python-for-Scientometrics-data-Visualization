Using the MACTOR (Matrix of Alliances and Conflicts: Tactics, Objectives and Recommendations) method, a set of 13 related journals covering the subject category "Chemistry, Multi disciplinary" was analyzed in terms of direct and indirect reciprocal influences (measured by relatedness indexes Rji), their positions towards a generic set of common objectives (total cites; impact factor; immediacy index; number of published articles; cited half life) and the convergences (Actors x Actors and Actors x Objectives) existing in the above-mentioned relatedness network. The study identified 4 types of actors: dominant (3), independent (8), relay (1) and dominated (1)- Maps of: influences and dependences between actors; convergence between actors; net distances between actors and actors-objectives relationships are presented, together with short interpretations. Defining scientific journals as actors on a specific "knowledge market", identifying influences and dependences between them and positioning these journals towards a set of measurable objectives creates an interesting possibility to define "relationships of power" of a strategic nature and enables the introduction of more complex future-oriented scientometric analyses than those based solely on standard bibliometric indicators such as the impact factor.
