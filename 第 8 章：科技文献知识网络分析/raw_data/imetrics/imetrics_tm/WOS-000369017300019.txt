u A work strand planned by the Science Europe Working Group on Research Policy and Programme Evaluation aims at mapping the state of affairs in data collection and their use at European funding and research organisations. In particular, the project identifies and proposes solutions for issues experienced by the Member Organisations (MO) regarding collection, standardisation and treatment of data related to the analysis and ex-post evaluation of activities funded or performed by MOs. This is implemented through a survey sent to the MOs. The survey was analysed with special attention to the particular needs of funding and performing organisations. On the basis of the results and the discussion among the work strand members and within the WG, we draw a preliminary set of conclusions to produce guidance on relevant topics, including researcher and funding identification, potential, properties and limitations of data and indicators that are used in the context of measurement of research output and its assessment, classification systems used in sciences systems including their various types and issues of availability, confidentiality and harmonisation of data and indicators. Feedback from such discussions will be used to identify areas for further action by Science Europe.
