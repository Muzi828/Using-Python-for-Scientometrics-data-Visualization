It can be shown that claims of a lack of theories of citation are also indicative of a grate need for a theory which links science dynamics and measurement. There is a wide gap between qualitative (science dynamics) and quantitative (measurement) approaches. To link them, the present study proposes the use of the citation system, that potentially bridges a gap between measurement and epistemology, by applying system theory to the publication system.(1)
