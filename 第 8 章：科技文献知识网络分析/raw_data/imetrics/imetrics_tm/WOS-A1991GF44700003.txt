There is a rapid growth of cancer literature.  Thousands of papers are being regularly published every year not only in speciality journals, but also in journals of other disciplines.  Citation studies are nowadays considered a major basis of science indicators for ascertaining the importance of a scientific journal and that of the published articles on a particular subject.  In oncological research the journal Cancer is considered as one of the top most journals and is universally well known for its high standard and excellence.  In this paper an attempt has been made to find out the importance of all the articles published in it for a particular year.  Side by side bibliometric analysis was made to ascertain various other aspects like time lag between publication and first citation of articles, average citation time, subject scattering and identification of most important journals in the field etc.  It is believed that this study would be of help to the working oncologists, librarians and information scientists to assess the importance of articles published in a top ranking journal of cancer and also that of different journals publishing oncological research results.
