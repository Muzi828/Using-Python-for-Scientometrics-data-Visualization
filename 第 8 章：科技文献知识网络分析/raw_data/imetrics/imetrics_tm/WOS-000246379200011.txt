This study investigates the potential impact of open access pricing on institutional journal expenditures in four subject fields at nine American colleges and universities. Three pricing models are evaluated: the conventional model (the current subscription model), the PLoS open access model (based on the fees currently charged by the Public Library of Science), and the equal-revenue open access model (which maintains current levels of total aggregate spending within each subject field). Because institutional disparities in publishing productivity are far greater than institutional disparities in library holdings, the shift from a subscription-based model to either open access model would bring dramatic cost savings for most colleges and universities. At the same time, a small number of institutions-the top research universities-would pay a far higher proportion of the total aggregate cost.
