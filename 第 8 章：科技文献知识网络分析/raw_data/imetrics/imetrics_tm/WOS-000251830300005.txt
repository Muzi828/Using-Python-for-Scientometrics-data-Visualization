Q-measures for binary divided networks were introduced in 2004. These measures can value the status of notes as linkage (or bridges) between two groups in a connected undirected network. We collected data from the Web of Science and used a computer programme in order to study Qmeasures for an England-Germany collaboration network in fluid mechanics. The result indicates that Cambridge University, Manchester University, Technische Universitat Berlin, the Max Planck Institute, Stuttgart University and Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe play the most important roles as bridges between England and Germany. It is shown that having a high degree centrality and being a key node are important factors explaining the ranking of nodes in a network according to Q-value. It is observed that institutes with a high Q-value have, on average, a higher production than those with a lower Q-value.
