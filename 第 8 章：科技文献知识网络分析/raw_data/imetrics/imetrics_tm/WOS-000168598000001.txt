This paper presents a citation analysis of the cognitive structure of current cardiovascular research. Used methods are co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling and quantitative analysis of title words. Tables and graphs reveal: (1) The journal co-citation structure; (2) the cognitive content and the bibliometric structure of clusters based on co-citation: (3) the cognitive content and the bibliometric structure of clusters based on bibliographic coupling. A predominance of different research aspects on coronary artery disease was found in clusters based on co-citations as well as in dusters based on bibliographic coupling.
