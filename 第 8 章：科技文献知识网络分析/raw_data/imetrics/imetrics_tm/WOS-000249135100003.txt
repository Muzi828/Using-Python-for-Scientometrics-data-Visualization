The development of a facet analysis system to code and analyze data in a mixed-method study is discussed. The research goal was to identify the dimensions of interaction that contribute to student satisfaction in online Web-supported courses. The study was conducted between 2000 and 2002 at the Florida State University School of Information Studies. The researchers developed a facet analysis system that meets S. R. Ranganathan's (1967) requirements for articulation on three planes (idea, verbal, and notational). This system includes a codebook (verbal), coding procedures, and formulae (notational) for quantitative analysis of logs of chat sessions and postings to discussion boards for eight master's level courses taught online during the fall 2000 semester. Focus group interviews were subsequently held with student participants to confirm that results of the facet analysis reflected their experiences with the courses. The system was developed through a process of emergent coding. The researchers have been unable to identify any prior use of facet analysis for the analysis of research data as in this study. Identifying the facet analysis system was a major breakthrough in the research process, which, in turn, provided the researchers with a lens through which to analyze and interpret the data. In addition, identification of the faceted nature of the system opens up new possibilities for automation of the coding process.
