An analysis of 785 papers, books and reports, in the field of laser, published from India during 1967-84, indicates that Indian output comprises almost 1% of the international output. The total output came from 77 academic and research institutions, out of which 10 institutions contributed almost 23%. Major portion of these publications appeared in foreign journals of repute, as reflected by their impact factors. Emphasis has been on theoretical aspects of laser research. The laser research performed in India appears to be a part of mainstream science as indicated by the pattern of publications and citations. The study also indicates that Indian scientists have few international collaboration in this field. A mathematical model for growth of literature output shows that though the rate of Indian literature output peaked at about the same time as that of the world output, Indian output may start getting marginalised by 1995. The model indicates that reasons for this lie in relatively less emphasis in India on experimental and applied aspects of laser research compared to international averages.
