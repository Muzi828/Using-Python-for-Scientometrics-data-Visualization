This is an analysis of the scientific production of the Spanish research community compiled by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) during the period 1983-1989 through indicators of publications (scientific output) that have been accepted, more and more frequently, as tools for decision-making. The percentages of the total number of articles per year are defined and the temporal evolution is shown of the orders of quality of the hypothetical journals that represent the whole production. A new indicator is used for comparisons between scientific subjects and thematic areas. Finally, mention is made of the spectacular growth of the Spanish scientific production in the period referred to, not only in quantity but also in quality through the indicators considered.
