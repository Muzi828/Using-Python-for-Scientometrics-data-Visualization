This article examines the knowledge structure of the field of space communications using bibliometric mapping techniques based on textual analysis. A new approach with the aim of visualizing simultaneously the configuration of its scientific and technological knowledge bases is presented. This approach enabled us to overcome various limits of existing bibliometric methods dealing with science and technology relationships. The bibliometric map revealed weak cognitive interactions between science and technology at the worldwide level, although it brought out the systemic nature of the process of knowledge production at either side. We extended the mapping approach to the R&D activities of the Triad countries in order to characterize their specialization profiles and cognitive links on both sides in comparison with the structure of the field at the worldwide level. Results showed different patterns in the way the Triad countries organized their scientific and technological activities within the field.
