This article proposes a method for characterizing the "activity profiles" of research laboratories. It is based on the "research compass card model" derived from the sociology of science, and which highlights the five complementary contexts in which research activities develop. A test was conducted in a regional setting on 75 labs. It demonstrates that simple indicators are enough to measure levels of involvement in each activity. Seven "activity profiles" based upon the mix by labs of their marked involvement were identified, crossing both institutional and disciplinary barriers.
