A bibliometric study based on the analysis of six Ph. D. thesis in economics. In this study the methodology is based on the distinction we made between two different information sources in each thesis: (1) the bibliography cited either at the end or at the beginning of the thesis; it represents the stock of useful or necessary publications; (2) the citations appearing in each dissertations as a whole; it determines the extent to which the stock is used, because it shows how many times a publication cited in the bibliography is cited in the thesis itself.
The results concern the ratio "number of titles/authors", the journal/monograph proportion, languages allocation, study of obsolescence. In the bibliography, 95% of books and articles are less than 30 years old. In the citations, articles and 95% of books are less than 20 years old.
