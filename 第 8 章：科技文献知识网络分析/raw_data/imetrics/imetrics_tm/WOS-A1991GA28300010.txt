Evidence from Greece suggests that after its accession to the EC the country benefited from a limited transfer of resources in form of R & D subsidies, which were heavily concentrated both sectorally and institutionally, hardly leading to marketable innovations.  A detailed analysis shows though that the country benefited more from the EC technology policy in the form of a) subsidies for R & D infrastructure and b) quick adaptation of its institutions to new challenges.  Based on this experience it is suggested that STRIDE, a Community R & D programme for less favoured regions, be evaluated with both cohesion and excellence indicators.
