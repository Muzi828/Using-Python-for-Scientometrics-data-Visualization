To identify the differences in the knowledge production between disciplines, we analyzed the. relation between the average paper length and impact factor of 100 journals from 5 disciplines. We found negative correlation between the average length and the impact factor in the natural sciences, but not in the social sciences. We also analyzed the structures of paper and the citation patterns. These analyses are expanded to the comparison between Mode 1 and Mode 2. All results showed the natural sciences articles could emphasize the differences from previous studies and be diffused effectively by the short standardized style of paper.
