A method is described for the generation of journal-journal citation maps on the basis of the CD-ROM version of the Science Citation Index.  Various sources of potential errors in using this data are discussed, and strategies are suggested to counteract these errors.  A number of scientometric journal mappings are analyzed in relation to mappings from previous studies which have used tape data and/or data from ISI's Journal Citation Reports.  The quality of these mappings is compared with the quality of those for previous years in order to demonstrate usefulness of such mappings as indicators for dynamic developments in the sciences.
