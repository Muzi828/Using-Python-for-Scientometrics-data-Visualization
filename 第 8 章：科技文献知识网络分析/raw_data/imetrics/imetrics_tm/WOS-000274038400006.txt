Automatic text classification (TC) is essential for the management of information. To properly classify a document d, it is essential to identify the semantics of each term t in d, while the semantics heavily depend on context (neighboring terms) of t in d. Therefore, we present a technique CTFA (Context-based Term Frequency Assessment) that improves text classifiers by considering term contexts in test documents. The results of the term context recognition are used to assess term frequencies of terms, and hence CTFA may easily work with various kinds of text classifiers that base their TC decisions on term frequencies, without needing to modify the classifiers. Moreover, CTFA is efficient, and neither huge memory nor domain-specific knowledge is required. Empirical results show that CTFA successfully enhances performance of several kinds of text classifiers on different experimental data.
