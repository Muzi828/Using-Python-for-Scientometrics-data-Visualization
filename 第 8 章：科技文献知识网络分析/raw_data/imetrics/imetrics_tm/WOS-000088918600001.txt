We present a characterization of bibliometric output in Colombia resulting from research projects financed by COLCIENCIAS between 1983 and 1994 in the following programs: Health Sciences; Basic Science; Energy and Mining; Agricultural Sciences; Technological, Industrial and Quality Development; Marine Sciences; Social Sciences; Education; Environment and Habitat; Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Systems.
In the case of periodicals, we establish: patterns of production by author; patterns of publication in national journals vs. international journals; the effect of international collaboration in projects over publication in international journals; patterns of bibliometric production by fields of research using UNESCO classifications; a list of the most frequently used journals by Colombian researchers as vehicles to communicate their results; patterns of bibliometric production from Colombian institutions; geographical distribution of bibliometric output; and finally, a review on the mean number of authors of articles for some fields of science and technology. We present also theses production patterns for books and B.Sc., MSc. and PhD. theses using UNESCO codes of the projects.
We comment on the human resources formation. It is found as a dominant behavior of the so commented patterns a low index of publication per project and a high tendency in the distribution of publications to concentrate on few actors (researchers, institutions, origin of the publication, journals, human resources).
It is also found that there exists a strong concentration of bibliometric output in the program of Basic Sciences, in fields such as phytochemistry and solid state physics (super and semiconductors).
