The evolution of scientific fields analyzed by co-word analysis and presented in strategic diagrams is simulated based on the law of cumulative advantages - the probability of a new tie between two keywords depends positively on the frequencies in which both keywords have taken part already. The results we get from simulations are compared with the results of real scientific field evolution. We consider the high correspondence of both to be a proof of the working of the law of cumulative advantages in the development of scientific fields and we believe that our research opens new possibilities for predictions of the development of scientific fields.
