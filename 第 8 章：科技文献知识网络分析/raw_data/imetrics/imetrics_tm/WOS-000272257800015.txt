Digital artifacts have novel properties that largely derive from the processes that mediate their creation, and that can be best understood by a close examination of such processes. This paper introduces the concept of "quasi-object" to characterize these objects and elucidate the activities that comprise their mediations. A case study of "bugs" is analyzed to illustrate exemplary activities of justification, qualification, and binding in the process of bug fixing in Free/Open Source Software development. The findings of the case study lead to broader reflections on the character of digital artifacts in general. The relationship of "quasi-object" to other similar concepts are explored.
