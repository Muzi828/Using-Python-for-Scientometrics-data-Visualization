Based on the simulation study of the publication delay control process [YU & AL., 2005], transfer function models of delay control processes by adjusting the accepted contribution flux and the published contribution flux are identified using system identification. According to Cybernetics, the feedback control system of the publication delay is designed and control processes are simulated and analyzed when the average publication delay are regarded as the controlled object. On the basis of the relation between the average publication delay and the deposited contribution quantity, another control method is proposed that the deposited contribution quantity is regarded as the controlled object and the simulation result proves that the method is an excellent means and can help editors expediently manage their journals and control publication delays.
