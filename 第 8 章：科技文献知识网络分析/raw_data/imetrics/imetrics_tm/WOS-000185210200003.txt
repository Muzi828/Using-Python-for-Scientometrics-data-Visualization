To understand the human experience of libraries and the implications this understanding has for library use and service, education, and design, 118 undergraduate students were asked to list three personally memorable incidents concerning library use. Following this, they were asked to write a short narrative of one of these experiences. Incidents reported by participants ranged from preschool to college age, and content analysis indicated that a majority took place at two or more grade levels, sometimes as early as the participant's first (preschool) visit to a library. Phenomenological analysis of individual narratives produced a thematic structure for each of the four grade levels represented in the data: elementary school and younger, middle school, high school, and college/adult. Themes common across all four levels include Atmosphere, Size and Abundance, Organization/Rules and Their Effects on Me, and What I Do in the Library. A theme of Memories was unique to narratives that took place during elementary and younger age levels. Although all remaining themes were noted across age levels, the relative importance of various themes and subthemes was different at different ages. Implications of the thematic structure for library practice are discussed.
