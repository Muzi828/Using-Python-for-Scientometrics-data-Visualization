This paper deals with performance measures and performance indicators in the Impala electronic document ordering and delivery system for research libraries in Belgium and compares these with some international standards as, e.g., the ProLib/Pi study commissioned by the European Commission.
Performance measures:
Costs(clearinghouse principle)
Number of ILL requests made to other libraries
Number of ILL requests made to other libraries without success
Number of ILL requests made to other libraries with success
Number of ILL requests received from other libraries
Number of ILL requests received from other libraries and not satisfied
Number of ILL requests received from other libraries that were satisfied
Frequently asked titles
Performance indicators:
Success rate
Borrowing-lending ratio per library
Response times, split into several segments of the ILL-procedure
The article concludes with some indications for quality measurement in electronic document delivery where Impala will be able to measure the real supply times as perceived by the end user.
