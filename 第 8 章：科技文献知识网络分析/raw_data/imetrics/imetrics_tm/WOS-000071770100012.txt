Data visualization techniques have opened up new possibilities for science mapping. To exploit this opportunity new methods are needed to position tens of thousands of documents in a single coordinate space. A general framework is described for achieving this goal involving hierarchical clustering, ordination of clusters, and the merging of ordinations into a common coordinate space. The SciViz system is presented as one particular implementation of this framework.
