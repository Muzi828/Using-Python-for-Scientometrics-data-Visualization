This article reports the findings of a scientometric analysis of nanoscale research in South Africa during the period 2000-2005. The ISI databases were identified as the most appropriate information platform for the objectives of the investigation and have been interrogated for the identification of South African authors publishing in the field.
The article identifies trends over time, major institutional contributors, journals in which South African authors publish their research, international collaborators and performance in comparison to four comparator countries (India, Brazil, South Korea and Australia). The major findings of the investigation are as follows: nanoscale research in South Africa is driven by individual researchers interests up to date and it is in its early stages of development; the country's nanoscale research is below what would one expect in light of its overall publication output; the country's nano-research is distributed to a number of Universities with subcritical concentration of researchers.
