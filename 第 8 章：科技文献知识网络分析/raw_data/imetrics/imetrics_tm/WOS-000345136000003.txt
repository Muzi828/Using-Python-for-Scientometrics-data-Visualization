This paper provides useful insights for the design of networks that promote research productivity. The results suggest that the different dimensions of social capital affect scientific performance differently depending on the area of knowledge. Overall, dense networks negatively affect the creation of new knowledge. In addition, the analysis shows that a division of labor in academia, in the sense of interdisciplinary research, increases the productivity of researchers. It is also found that the position in a network is critical. Researchers who are central tend to create more knowledge. Finally, the findings suggest that the number of ties have a positive impact on future productivity. Related to areas of knowledge, Exact Sciences is the area in which social capital has a stronger impact on research performance. On the other side, Social and Humanities, as well as Engineering, are the ones in which social capital has a lesser effect. The differences found across multiple domains of science suggest the need to consider this heterogeneity in policy design.
