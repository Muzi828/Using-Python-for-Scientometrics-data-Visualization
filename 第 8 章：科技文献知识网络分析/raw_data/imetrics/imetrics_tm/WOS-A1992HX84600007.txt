A bibliometric study based on worldwide scientific and technical publications on refractory materials used in iron and steelmaking processes during 1980-87, has been carried out. Six bibliographic databases were searched and from them 2464 references were retrieved. The highest percentage of published documents were journal articles (60%), followed by patents (33%). The core journals are Ogneupory (USSR) and Taikabutsu (Japan). The USSR was by far the most productive country, both in number of published papers and in number of journal titles devoted to the subject. In The Soviet Union research work is mainly carried out in universities and institutes of the Academy of Sciences. On the other hand, Japan is the most productive country in patent registered, and research work is carried out there either in private refractory companies or in steelmaking enterprises. The trend in worldwide research points towards shaped refractories, particularly based in high alumina, magnesia, zircon carbides and mixtures containing oxides and carbon, which are largely used in converters, transport ladles and continuous casting processes.
