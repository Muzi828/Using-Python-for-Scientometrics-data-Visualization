Activity shares in different types of research work for coauthors of scientific papers were detected by questionnaire methods. It was found e.g. that first authors perform about 70 % of the total work needed for two authored papers, which decreases to 34% for papers with five authors. From Total Activity Shares determined for coauthors Total Team Contribution Factors could be calculated for cooperating teams. Total as well as Intramural and Extramural Team Cooperativeness for research teams were obtained by relating shares of impact factor scores for the investigated teams to the total.
