This work reports on the medical subject headings that build-up the medical education field in Latin America, through the content and citation analysis of Educacion Medica y Salud (EMS).  An attempt was made to establish the articulations between the citing and cited countries in the region.  It was generally found that EMS was built-up by subjects of Medical Education, Health Manpower, Water Supply, and Health Policy.  Although strongly citing/cited/indexed countries, Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia have not established significant information flows among them.  Further research lines are proposed.
