Attempts to reduce the multiplicity and variety of the range of indicators presently used to measure science and technology to lean patterns have so far proved unsuccessful.
The reason for this is the ongoing lack of an all-comprehensive theory to rationalise every aspect of intricate and as yet obscure processes such as scientific discovery and technological innovation. We ought to expect from a theory of scientific and technological progress satisfactory not only in abstract terms but also as an empirical analysis is a composition of two aspects - static and dynamic - in a few homogeneous variables.
